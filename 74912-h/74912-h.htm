</div>

<p class='c008'>An Indian council-fire was lighted on the banks of Seneca
lake; the flames streamed up cold and white in the radiance
of the setting sun, and the heavy clouds of smoke, tinged like
rainbows by its beams, rolled away over the forest and floated
in transparent mist over the Iroquois village built on a picturesque
curve of the shore. The glory of midsummer lighted up
the woods and lay warm and bright on the beautiful lake. It
was the season when all that was poetical and picturesque in
savage life wore its richest charms—when those rude natives
forgot all the hardships of the cold, stern winter, and yielded
themselves to the indolent enjoyment of the long, sunny days.</p>

<p class='c009'>A great stillness lay over the Seneca village; the people
had come out of their wigwams and were gathered as near
the council-fire as they dared approach, their picturesque
dresses lighting up the background until they looked like a
flock of strange tropical birds hovering around the flames
which they dared not approach. About the council-fire were
grouped the leading chiefs of the Six Nations’ tribes, who, for
several weeks past, had been participants in the unusual feasting
and merriment which had made the old forest joyous.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a band of noble, stately-looking men, sitting in a
circle in the red firelight, grave and dignified as Roman Senators
gathered in their forum, listening calmly to the various
speeches, weighing carefully each word and bringing all the
vivid power of acute minds to bear upon the matters in question.</p>

<p class='c009'>In their midst stood a woman in the fairest bloom of youth,
with her crimson robes falling so royally about her, and her
every gesture so full of intellect and refinement that any stranger
unacquainted with her history and her designs, might have almost
believed with the poor savages, that she was a direct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>messenger from heaven to work their good. This was Mahaska,
the white queen, or Mahaska the Avenger, as she loved
to call herself. She was Katharine, daughter of Frontenac, the
French Governor-General of Canada, by an Indian woman
who was daughter of the Seneca chief Nemono. When, in
accordance with the will of their dying prophet, they brought
the half-white girl Mahaska to be their principal ruler, most
of the chiefs among the nations were so deeply impressed by
the last revelations of their beloved prophet that they accepted
her presence and the state which she took upon herself with
the blind fidelity of humbler members of the several tribes;
but there were a few who, either from personal ambition or
the contempt for women which made a part of their savage
education, opposed her will in every way that they dared, and
were trying their utmost to raise up a party which would enable
them to counteract her rapidly-increasing influence. Mahaska,
perfectly acquainted with their plans, and confident of
her power to thwart them, only waited for the best moment
to crush their schemes forever by some daring act or some
craftily-woven plot, whichever should best suit her purposes
and be likely to produce the greatest effect on the tribe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska’s present ambition was a desire to wage war
against the Delawares—a powerful tribe residing south
of the Iroquois territory—who had been known to speak
slightingly of her claims. This she deemed a favorable opportunity
to prove her warlike powers to the Indians, and stronger
still was her desire to avenge the slightest affront offered her
by that powerful tribe and to crush any daring spirit
among her own people that had the audacity to dispute her
power.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the council-fire flamed up and the chiefs grew more and
more attentive, she spoke in her bold, imaginative way, carrying
the hearts of the people along with her by her resistless
eloquence, and noting the effect she produced by the occasional
murmurs which broke from the multitude stationed
in the background, in spite of the utter silence and decorum
it was their habit to preserve on such solemn occasions.</p>

<p class='c009'>She ended her thrilling appeal and turned toward the
chiefs, folding her statuesque arms over her bosom and with
the flame-tinted light quivering like a glory around her.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Mahaska has spoken,” she said; “let the chiefs weigh
well her words.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska’s voice is like the wind sent by the Great Spirit,”
returned the oldest chief in the assembly; “it goes straight to
the hearts of her brethren.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska speaks only as the Great Spirit commands her,”
she said, “from the wisdom of the visions which he sends to
her in the night time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little knot of chiefs who were opposed to her whispered
ominously among themselves—the woman’s quick eye
noticed this.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do the braves meet at the council-fire to hold secret consultations?”
she demanded, turning toward the old chief
Upepah.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They meet to speak their thoughts and wishes,” he answered;
“why is Mahaska troubled?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She pointed toward the little group and said in a low, silky
tone, which, after the savages learned to know her better, they
knew covered the fiercest and bitterest anger:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because, the Fox whispers among his friends and sneers
at Mahaska’s words.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chiefs turned toward the little party with frowning
brows, and murmurs of disapprobation broke from the people
in the background, over whom Mahaska’s influence already
was almost boundless.</p>

<p class='c009'>The braves with whom the Fox had been whispering
dropped slowly from his side, not daring to support his cause
however strongly their wishes might go with his. He was a
middle-aged man, with a peculiar depth of firmness and sullen
obstinacy in his face. Though he looked slightly discomposed
by this unexpected address, he bore the dissatisfied glances
with cold dignity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska came among her people because the Great Spirit
sent her, and because the Senecas asked her to come,” continued
the woman. “It is not well that, in the very outset of
her work among you, designing chiefs should whisper among
you like bad spirits to counteract her great purposes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A murmur went up from the crowd in echo to her words:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not well, it is not well!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska has obeyed her people’s wishes; she has chosen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>a husband from among their chiefs; if the Iroquois will listen
to her she will lead them on to new glory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They listen and cherish her words,” returned Upepah,
the old chief. “Mahaska has seen them rejoice over her
coming—she knows that the hearts of our braves and our
young maidens have been gladdened by her presence; let her
have faith in her people. She is a great chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned slowly toward him and lifted her face full upon
him and smiled with a power of fascination which lighted up her
features into wonderful beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has been the dream of Mahaska’s life to be with her
people,” she answered; “every wish in her heart has turned toward
them as a young bird pines for its nest in the green leaves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They have watched for her coming,” he said; “the young
maidens and children have been taught to speak her name
with reverence; they will come like children to hear the wisdom
which she has learned among the whites.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the chiefs listen too,” she exclaimed, with the arrogance
natural to her; “Mahaska has visions such as never
were unfolded to their greatest prophets; she will teach them
arts which will make them able to combat the cruel whites
who are seeking to tread out the red-man’s footsteps from the
broad lands their fathers owned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Iroquois have not had babes and cowards for their
chiefs,” said the Fox, unable to keep silent, however unfit
the moment to dispute her wishes, or however dangerous to
himself might be the result of bringing the angry feelings
between them to an issue before the council.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska scanned his lofty figure from head to foot; the
smile did not leave her features, but it looked on the hardness
of her face like sunlight playing over ice, and the light in her
eyes deepened and grew vicious like those of a serpent just
ready to spring.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chief is not content with the woman chief his people
have chosen,” she said, in her lowest, softest tone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska mistakes,” he answered; “the Fox welcome
her willingly as his brothers, but he never heard that she was
to sit at the council-fire and be treated as a chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When Mahaska is not a chief she leaves the tribe forever,”
she replied calmly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Mahaska is married; why does not Gi-en-gwa-tah her
husband speak for her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The young chief to whom he alluded rose on the instant
and answered with stately pride:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah is chief of the Senecas, but he can not know
the visions which Mahaska sees; the Great Spirit converses
with her as he did with our prophet, but her husband is like
his brethren, only a warrior; he can not understand words
from the Great Spirit.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska gave him an approving glance and moved nearer
the council-fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the Fox speak,” she said; “what are his thoughts?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus unexpectedly confronted by the woman armed with
the double spell of her gorgeous beauty and the spiritual influence
which she had over the minds of a superstitious people,
the chief was at loss to reply. For a few seconds he sat silent
while Mahaska watched him with a look of grave expectation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why is the Fox silent?” she cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is not a woman that his words should fall easily and
are lost, like the rain,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” she exclaimed, “he is silent because he is true to
his name—because he is crafty and wants to work under
ground; he wishes to carry on his plans in the dark and uproot
the love of the people for Mahaska, but when he looks in
her face he has no courage to speak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the chief a child that he should fear to look a woman
in the face?” the chief returned, contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c009'>A deadly sweetness deepened the smile that still played
over Mahaska’s lips. She evinced no other sign of the fierce
passion which raged in her soul and which made her determine
that the struggle between them should not be prolonged
until the weight of his influence and years should be able to
tell against her claims. The strife between them should end
then and there—either disgrace or death should be his portion;
she would risk all her power in one daring act.</p>

<p class='c009'>As yet, though her influence was great, she could not count
fully upon the savages. A few years later and the slavish
submission to which she had reduced them was so entire that
if she ever looked back upon that scene she smiled with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>contempt at the hesitation and caution which she had been
constrained to use. Her passion and desire for revenge now
overswept all bounds, making her alike insensible to the future,
personal safety, every thing that stood between her and
the gratification of her unwomanly hate.</p>

<p class='c009'>The words of the Fox were received with new signs of
disapproval by the people; the elder chiefs looked puzzled
and surprised; those who had promised to support him kept
aloof; but all these things only excited the obstinacy of the
Indian—he would not yield then. Gi-en-gwa-tah, Mahaska’s
newly-made husband, had started forward at those contemptuous
words, but a glance from his wife restrained him and he
fell back among the leading chiefs, panting with rage.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska drew her figure to its full hight. She pointed her
finger at the Fox with a look of withering scorn, and her
voice rung out over the crowd clear and distinct as the tones
of a trumpet:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chiefs hear!” she exclaimed; “the people hear; will
they be silent? Years ago the Senecas were warned by their
prophet that the granddaughter of the great Nemono would
one day come among them; he bade them listen and obey
her implicitly, and promised that she would make them the
greatest tribe among all the Six Nations. Mahaska came—she
had been reared by the Great Spirit for that purpose—even
in her childhood she had visions such as never came to the
wisest of your old men; she obeyed the voice of the prophet—she
came among her people to lead them on to power and
glory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Subdued acclamations went up, but she checked the sound
by a gesture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Upon the very entrance to her career she is checked by
this crafty Fox; he seeks to undermine her power; the Great
Spirit has warned Mahaska how he plots against her, but she
does not fear his snares. Mahaska must be respected and
obeyed; her power is that of a prophet and a chief; she is
led by the voice of the Manitou and she can never err. She
will not argue with this base dog; she will not stand at the
council-fire where he is permitted to stand; she will reveal no
wishes of the Great Spirit—hold no communion with her people,
until they promise to heed her will in all things.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Even the presence of the chiefs could not restrain the cry
of dismay which went up from the tribe at her words. The
Fox heard the ominous sound and knew that his scheme of
resistance had failed—the wily woman had forced on the struggle
before he was prepared, and was crushing him under the
suddenness of the blow; but to yield was not in his nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Fox was a great brave,” he said, “before Mahaska’s
feet had learned to walk alone; her voice is only the voice of
a woman; she has still many things to learn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a murmur from the crowd growing more and
more excited; reverence to the girl had been taught them as
a part of their religion, and they clung to the faith with all
the blindness and intensity of their untutored natures.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again Mahaska’s voice rung out with something so ominous
and deep in its tone that even the obstinate savage quailed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be silent while Mineto speaks through my voice,” she cried.
Even her enemy started back and gazed on her with bated
breath. “Mahaska came here at the request of her people,”
she said, in that deep, persuasive voice that rolled like rich
music through the throng. “She has been sent by the Great
Spirit to give counsel to her people, to teach them new power
and glory. Had she found already disobedience and insult?
She will go away—will return to her white brethren. Let a
boat be made ready—she will leave her people. Mineto
commands it. When a chief of the tribes disputes her power
she will not stay.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a universal exclamation of terror at her words,
and they crowded about her as if to prevent the fulfillment of
her threat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The maiden speaks with too much fire,” still persisted the
Fox; “her words leap out like a mountain torrent; those who
rule should talk slowly and weigh well their words.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At that instant a black cloud swept up the horizon and hovered
directly over their heads; Mahaska was not slow to notice
and to work upon their superstitious fears by pointing it
out as an omen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Behold!” she exclaimed, pointing on high. “The Great
Spirit sends a sign; he is angry with his people! Is this the
welcome they give his messenger? Let them beware! Famine
and pestilence shall weaken their strength; the white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>men shall take them as slaves; the glory of the Six Nations
shall go out forever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They fairly trembled at her words, delivered with all the fire
of an inspired prophetess. Angry murmurs rose around the
chief who had incurred her anger; but with true savage obstinacy
he would not yield.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Senecas have been a nation of warriors since the
Great Spirit sent the red-men upon the earth,” said he; “it is
not at the voice of a maiden that he will weaken their braves
and destroy their women.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The half-breed’s fury was now aroused to its deadliest heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Either the lying-tongued warrior is given up to my vengeance,”
she cried, “or I quit the tribe forever! Do not
think to detain me—the Great Spirit would send down a
chariot of fire from yonder cloud and bear me from your
sight, did I not execute my wishes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Mahaska decide!” exclaimed numberless voices; but
the chiefs about the council-fire were silent, scarcely knowing
how to act in this strange turn of affairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska will not wait,” she cried, in a strong voice; “the
chiefs hear the voice of the people; let them give up the lying
dog or Mahaska leaves them forever. Behold the black
cloud—how it spreads and deepens—coming nearer and nearer
to snatch Mahaska from her tribe. So Mineto speaks; his
voice breaks from the cloud.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A low roll of thunder preceded her words by a single moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no!” shouted the crowd. “Mahaska shall not go—give
up the Fox to her—give him up! give him up!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The doomed man sat motionless in his place; not a muscle
quivered; not a line in his face betrayed the terrible suspense
which he endured.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Will the chiefs speak?” cried Mahaska; “are they dumb
<a id='t12'></a>or do they dare to hesitate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She flung up both arms toward the black cloud and muttered
words in a language unknown to them. The heavy
cloud settled lower and lower as if approaching slowly at
some mandate of her own. A quiver of flame ran through
it, and the thunder that had but muttered before boomed out
fearfully. Chiefs and people were alike terrified at the idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of her being suddenly snatched from among them by supernatural
means, and they cried out like the voice of one man:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Mahaska’s will be obeyed. She is our prophet and
Gi-en-gwa-tah is our chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Rendered desperate by his situation, the doomed savage exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Senecas are dogs to be led by a woman. The Delawares
were right—they are dogs and cowards.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A sudden rush was made toward the spot where he stood,
but the woman sprung between the savages and her victim.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Back!” she shouted. “Who dares to come between Mahaska
and her prey!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her hair had broken loose from its coronet of feathers and
streamed heavily over her shoulders; her rich dress flashed
out in the firelight as the dusk increased; her face was like
that of some beautiful fiend.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before any one could move again she snatched a tomahawk
from the belt of the nearest chief and flung it with unerring
aim. A low, dull, horrible <em>swash</em> followed. The Indian gave
one terrible cry—a fierce leap into the air, and fell dead upon
the ashes of the council-fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska has obeyed the great Mineto!” she exclaimed;
“so perish all her enemies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She saw the savages standing stupefied, and pointed again to
the cloud, which began to drift slowly away, sending back
fiery threads of lightning.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Behold!” she cried. “The cloud-chariot is floating off—Mahaska
will stay with her people, but they must obey her,
worship her, for she and Mineto are one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She rushed toward the prostrate body—tore off the eagle
plume that decorated his head, fastened it in her hair, still
crying wildly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska is sister to the Great Spirit; who dares doubt
her now? She has killed a warrior and wears his plume.
Mineto made her a prophet. She has made herself a chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The warriors gathered in a circle around the council-fire.
Mahaska stood in the center with one foot on the breast of
her prostrate foe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Speak!” she said; “is Mahaska your prophet and your
chief?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“Mahaska is our prophet and our white queen. Gi-en-gwa-tah
is her husband and our chief,” was the steadfast
reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>For one moment Mahaska’s face was as the thunder-cloud,
but with acute foresight she saw that her power had been
tasked to the utmost. The tribe was not prepared to acknowledge
her as the supreme head of its warriors, and she
was not yet strong enough to brave the band of chiefs that
surrounded her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her face cleared. She looked down at the body of her foe
and spurned it with her foot. With a fierce gesture she
wrenched away the tomahawk which the dead chief still
clutched in his hand, wielding it aloft.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska has won her right to be called a chief,” she
cried out, with fierce pride. “Do her people doubt now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again that great shout went up:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our queen, our queen! We accept the gift of the Great
Spirit. Mahaska shall be our queen forever!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stepped proudly into the center of the ring, her hand
still grasping the tomahawk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Chiefs,” she cried, “behold Mahaska is now indeed a
queen. The lightning crowns her. The great Mineto shouted
from the sky when she clove that traitor’s skull.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They crowded about her with subdued acclamations and
lowly reverence; and there she stood in the fading glories of
the sunset, with that cruel smile upon her lips, that deadly
light in her eyes, to receive the homage of her people; yet her
bosom heaved in its rage, that they had insisted on sharing
her sovereignty with Gi-en-gwa-tah. She was queen, but he
was chief and her husband.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c007'>THE TIGRESS DALLYING WITH HER PREY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>While the savage enthusiasm of the gathered people was
at its hight, Mahaska did not forget to urge anew the wish
for a chieftainship, which the dead Fox had opposed. Her
set purpose was in no manner changed by the evident decision
of the chiefs to consider her their prophet and queen—not
their chiefest chief. They said, “Gi-en-gwa-tah is our
chief, as he is your husband;” thus implying that she was not
supreme. A great throb of pain, the pang of a thwarted
ambition, shot through her bosom. Had she, the daughter
of the noble Frontenac, deserted her father’s halls of splendor—had
she cast her civilization away and wedded, at the
command of her Indian half-countrymen, a savage chief—all
to be denied the prize for which she had aimed? No! the
fierce heart of the woman cried; she would be chief not
alone of the Senecas, but chief of her husband—chief of the
Six Nations; she would be supreme, or be powerless altogether.
She glanced toward Gi-en-gwa-tah, her eyes fairly
blazing with indignation. A sense of intense dislike of him
surged through her breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>His brow was overcast with thought; there was a heavy
pain in the stern, dark eyes. Love for his beautiful wife had
become so strong in his savage nature, that it was absolute
idolatry; but, with all his bravery, his heart was gentle and
tender almost as a woman’s. It had sent a terrible shock
through his whole being when he saw Mahaska, with her own
hand, deal that death-blow to his enemy. Not that he loved
her less; his savage teachings made him admire her daring;
but the pain was at his heart, notwithstanding, and he shuddered
when he saw the blood-stain on that slender white
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>The young chief felt no jealousy of his wife for the supremacy
she had gained over the people. He believed, firmly as
the others, in her supernatural powers; but the sneers of the
murdered man had touched him to the quick—he burned for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>some opportunity to prove to his people that he did not bury
his manhood in the reflected glory of a woman, however
much he might bow before her claims as a prophetess and
the descendant of their great medicine men, by whom she
had been bequeathed to the tribe.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whatever the feelings might be which actuated him, Mahaska
could not afford then to allow any cloud to come between
them—hereafter it would matter little; her eagle gaze
was looking forward to a future of undivided sway, to which
the present was but a stepping-stone.</p>

<p class='c009'>She motioned the chiefs to approach her, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The council-fire has been kindled in vain—the braves
have forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska is wrong,” returned Upepah; “the chiefs never
forget; let them hear the queen speak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Delawares are our neighbors, but Shewashiet, a chief
of their tribe, has said that the Senecas are cowards, because
they have chosen a woman for their great medicine prophet.
You have just proclaimed Gi-en-gwa-tah your first chief. Let
him take a band of warriors and bring Mahaska her traducer’s
scalp. It shall be a proof that he is worthy to share her rule
over a great tribe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A shout of exultation went up from the body of youthful
warriors, checked at once by a sign from the old chief. They
looked at her with new pride and wonder. To their savage
natures, the bloodthirsty spirit she evinced had nothing revolting
in it; they only worshiped her the more for her ferocious
decision.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah placed himself by her side, uttering a shrill
battle-shout. Again there was a consultation about the council-fire,
then Upepah said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen has spoken well. In three days the braves
will set out upon the war-path. Our young chief shall earn
another plume.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned toward the young men and delivered an address
full of fire and passion, calculated to inflame still more their
desires and ambition. Then the chiefs rose—the council was
broken up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska made a proud obeisance of farewell, and passed
out of the throng, casting a meaning glance at Gi-en-gwa-tah,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>who was conversing with Upepah, which he understood as a
sign that she desired to speak with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The whole band of young warriors filed into procession
and followed at a little distance in her footsteps, till she
reached her lodge. She turned at the entrance, bowed a last
farewell, and disappeared, retiring to her own inner room.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska now sat down upon a pile of furs, and gave herself
up to hard, cruel thought. The straight, black brows
contracted, the great eye gleamed out hatefully beneath, and
her whole face so changed and darkened under her wicked
reflections that it looked years older.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first obstacle in her path had been swept aside—her
first foe had fallen a victim to her vengeance; the gratification
of her own evil passions had only strengthened her
power.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was no regret in that cruel heart, even in the solitude
of her lodge. Though her half-savage nature had been
refined by education, and softened by the best blood of France,
every instinct of her soul became barbarous under the reign
of her vaunting ambition, and of her desire to avenge supposed
wrongs. It seemed as if the white blood in her veins
had turned drop by drop to hate. So hideous a transformation
it was hard to conceive, but history writes that it was so,
and her extraordinary career has left behind records enough
to prove her to have been more savage, more treacherous,
more relentless, than the untutored barbarian would have
been. Katharine Frontenac, when she threw aside her civilized
life, became Mahaska, the Avenger. The avenger of
what? She forced herself to say that her father, Count
Frontenac, had neglected her mother, Chileli, whom he had
chosen as his lawful wife, but whom he had killed by neglect.
As Katharine Frontenac, she had dared to love, with a fierce,
wild love, a French cavalier, but he had spurned her, and had
wedded another—her rival sister, a child of Frontenac’s second
wife, the beautiful Countess Adèle. It was this rejection
which had decided her to cast away all the ties of civilization,
to become a tigress in the wilderness—this rejection which
had turned all the sweet springs of her spontaneous, exuberant
nature into waters not of bitterness alone, but of qualities repulsive
enough to slake the thirst of ghouls.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>After a time she heard Gi-en-gwa-tah’s step in the outer
room; at the sound, her hand instinctively clenched the handle
of her tomahawk, in unison with the deadly thought in
her mind. The loathing which she first had felt when forced
to wed the noble savage, grew every day more deep. She
inwardly shrunk from the earnest devotion which beamed in
his eyes—from the anxious love with which he watched her
every glance; but now that he stood in her path, she began
to scorn and to hate him.</p>

<p class='c009'>For the present it must be endured with that patience and
craft which were the inheritance of her Indian blood; but
woe to the hapless man when the hour came that should enable
her to carry out the schemes which had been in her mind
even on the very day when he led her to his lodge.</p>

<p class='c009'>He swept aside the furs which hung before the entrance to
Mahaska’s lodge, and entered the apartment; she sat there so
peaceful and calm in her splendid beauty, that it hardly seemed
possible she could have been the author of the bloody deed
which had filled every heart in the tribe with consternation,
scarcely an hour before. Perhaps some such thought was in
the Indian’s mind as he stood looking down upon her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first sound of her voice was low and sweet as that of
some woodland bird hushing her young:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah has left the chiefs’ company for that of
Mahaska,” she said. “Mahaska thanks him for it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska’s wishes are always pleasant to Gi-en-gwa-tah,”
he answered; “she signed him to follow as she left the
council-fire.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman motioned him to her side with a smile of winning
sweetness. For the present she must essay all her arts
of fascination to retain him her slave; the day was not far
off when she would boldly declare her will, and crush him in
her path if he disputed it. But that time had not yet come,
and now she was anxious to remove from his mind the impression
left there by her cruel murder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have they taken away that dog of a chief?” she asked,
as he seated himself at her side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The squaws of burthen have carried him into the woods,”
he answered, gravely; “there is no burial for a brave dishonored
and disgraced.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The woman laid her hand softly on his arm:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah’s brow is dark; there is a shadow on his
heart because Mahaska his queen revenged herself on her
enemy. She was warned by the prophet that this man’s
death was necessary; he was dangerous to Mahaska; he
would have disputed her power, and led his people into great
troubles. Mahaska does not love to shed blood, but she must
obey her visions; she was warned to do this.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She spoke in a tone which greatly impressed the brave;
he had the most implicit faith in her supernatural communications.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska has done well,” he answered; “she is a chief
now—she might tread the war-path with the noblest of the
tribe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, Mahaska does not wish Gi-en-gwa-tah to think her
cruel,” she said; “she is a woman to him—she loves the
chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His dusky face glowed under her words, spoken in that
thrilling, impassioned tone. She watched him narrowly. To
her crafty nature there was a bitter pleasure in this loathsome
deceit; the more fondly he loved her, the sterner the retribution
she should be able in the future to bring upon him for
having been the man whom fate had assigned as her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Fox hated Gi-en-gwa-tah,” she went on; “he was
plotting against him; cannot Gi-en-gwa-tah think why? <em>He</em>
wanted to be the husband of the queen—he would have used
all his arts to put the young chief away, that he might aspire
to his place.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A fierce light shot into Gi-en-gwa-tah’s eye; she had
touched the right chord; he forgot every thing, except that
the murdered man would have conspired against his happiness
with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The dog is dead,” he hissed; “let him lie unburied; his
carcass shall become food for the crows. Mahaska has done
well; her visions never speak falsely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled in his face, with the fascination which, in her
past life, had thrilled many a noble white heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Henceforth, even the memory of the Fox shall not desecrate
Mahaska’s lodge,” she said; “his spirit is with the dark
shadows that can never enter the happy hunting-grounds.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>She changed the subject, and began speaking of the expedition
which was to take place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah will lead the young braves,” she said;
“Upepah has promised Mahaska. While he follows the war-path,
and brings back her enemy’s scalp, Mahaska will work
for him at the council; her chief shall be the greatest of the
Six Nations.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He listened eagerly to the visions of future greatness which
she called up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska is happy,” he exclaimed, suddenly, giving utterance
to some train of thought which had been called up by
her words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Happy?” she repeated. “Why does Gi-en-gwa-tah ask
idle questions?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was no question,” he replied; “Gi-en-gwa-tah sees
that she is content. Once he feared that the dark forest
might look dreary to her. Mahaska, in the Governor’s palace,
has been reared gently; he feared that she might regret all
that she left behind in the white settlements.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska’s brow darkened when her life among the whites
was spoken of. She had left nothing there but a dead youth,
crushed, under terrible hate and thwarted dreams. The dreams
were buried deep in the past; the hatred she brought in her
heart to the forest, to be nursed and strengthened until she
should be able to make the loathed race feel its most deadly
sting.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska is among her people,” she said, proudly; “she
has obeyed the will of the Manitou, and dwells among them
as their queen. What should she regret?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But his words recalled the one era in her life when tender
emotions had for a time softened her heart. She looked at
the Indian; she remembered the noble pale-face whom she
had given a love intense with the passion and fire of her Indian
nature; she remembered how she had been scorned and
set aside for another: the hatred she had vowed against the
man who had preferred another to her, was reflected toward
the savage who had come between her and the lonely state
which she had struggled to maintain, but which she had to
forego in order to gain ascendency over the tribes. It was
difficult for her to feign longer; she was young still, and her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>self-control could sometimes be shaken. At such times it was
necessary to be alone, that no human being might suspect the
tempest which stirred her whole nature to revolt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Gi-en-gwa-tah return to the chiefs,” she said; “Mahaska
hears the voices of her spirits; they have promised to
come to her to-night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Indian rose at once, with a sudden awe settling over
the gravity of his countenance; he glanced furtively about,
as if almost expecting to see some trace of the supernatural
beings of whom she spoke.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the morning Mahaska will tell her dreams to the chief,”
she said; “many things have been whispered faintly to her
which will now be said clearly. Gi-en-gwa-tah will follow
their warning?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Always,” he answered; “Mahaska is the chosen of the
Manitou—her words are full of wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He went away softly, as if fearing to disturb the mysterious
silence of the lodge by a footfall, and Mahaska sat there
in her loneliness until the night was almost spent—communing
indeed with spirits, the dark, distorted shapes which rose
out of the depths of her now bloodstained soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she threw herself upon her couch, it was only to
pursue in sleep those bloody reflections, and if the face of the
dead man, the first victim in her path, rose before her, it only
brought with it a fiendish exultation at her own success, and
a sterner determination to carry out her schemes, however
dark the way and fierce the tempest through which they
might lead her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III.<br> <span class='c007'>THE REVELATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>A dark plot lay buried in Mahaska’s soul, of which she
had as yet given no hint even to the chiefs. She intended to
forsake the alliance with the French and carry the Six Nations
over to the service of the English in the war then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>imminent between the two powers. But the time for that action
had not yet arrived, though her thoughts were constantly
dwelling upon it, and after that night’s thought she rose up
stronger and more determined than ever, as her hatred for the
French increased from the reflections which Gi-en-gwa-tah’s
words had aroused in her mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before giving any clue to her scheme to the other chiefs, she
wished to sound Gi-en-gwa-tah upon the subject and learn if
it was possible that he could be brought to second her schemes.
She knew how honorable he was, unlike the generality of his
nation; in his eyes a pledge was sacred, and the very idea of
breaking off the alliance with the French, unless some treachery
or ill-treatment on their part gave reason for it, would
have been abhorrent to him. Still, with all her wonderful
knowledge of human nature, she did not thoroughly understand
the chief; she could not give his savage mind credit for
all the uprightness which it possessed; so utterly false was
she herself that, with the usual weakness of such natures, she
believed that every man could be induced to yield to a plan
which he felt to be wrong if the personal temptation and reward
were sufficiently strong.</p>

<p class='c009'>Long before she left her girlish home in Quebec to dwell
among the Indians, this idea of breaking off the alliance with
the French had been paramount in her mind, and it was only
the lack of opportunity which had prevented her already
making such communications to the English Generals as would
induce them to offer overtures to the tribes then comprised in
the great Iroquois league known in history as the Six Nations,
of whom it was now her scheme to become sole chief. She
was not aware how strong a feeling of friendliness Gi-en-gwa-tah
held toward the French, and she determined, even before
he went away upon the war-path, to give him some idea of
the plan in her mind under the promise of inviolable secrecy;
well knowing that, however he might regard her design, she
could trust his word; the most fearful tortures could not
have wrung from him a secret which he had pledged himself
to preserve.</p>

<p class='c009'>There were many things besides her hatred of the French
urging her on in this matter, though that was the dark foundation
upon which all her plans were laid, and other desires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>were faint and poor beside the craving for vengeance which
filled her soul against her father’s people. She felt certain
that the English would aid her in her schemes if she would
turn the tribes over to them—they would do their utmost to
increase among the Indians a belief in her supernatural gifts,
they would lavish upon her rich presents and plentiful sums
of money which would make her still more powerful and
more firmly settled in her sway.</p>

<p class='c009'>All these things she was confident an alliance with the
English would afford her, and she determined to enter upon
her work at once. Difficulties had, for a long time, been frequent
between the French and British, and she saw clearly
that, ere long, they must ripen into war. It was for that she
wished to be prepared.</p>

<p class='c009'>She wanted so to work upon the minds of the leaders of
the tribes that they would be ready to fall into her plans when
the moment arrived; she wished the rupture to be sudden;
she would deceive the French up to the last moment and then
turn unexpectedly against them in some battle, and overwhelm
them by this sudden onset of the savages whom they had
treated as allies and friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her thoughts rushed forward to the time when she might
actually rush into Quebec with her train of bloodthirsty Indians,
carrying desolation and death into the city of her birth.
She recalled the streets and houses familiar to her girlish
years; in fancy she saw them in flames and heard the death-shrieks
from scores of voices that had been familiar in the
past and had known only accents of friendship and affection
for her. But she only remembered, with added hatred, all
who had shown her kindness. Every proof of affection had
stung her like a wrong. They had dared to pity her for the
Indian blood which darkened her veins, and their kindness
had sprung out of the commiseration they felt for her condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day would come when they should be repaid with interest—when
she would give back dagger-thrusts for every
tender smile, and laugh at the death-agonies of those who had
sought to brighten her first youth by their sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah was sitting in their lodge during the early
part of the day which had crowned her bloodily as queen,
when she said, abruptly:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“Mahaska had strange visions last night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned toward her with a face full of curiosity and interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What did the voices say to Mahaska?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They spoke vaguely,” she replied—“for Mahaska’s ear alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked disappointed, and she added, in her softest voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But things which Mahaska would not declare at the council,
surely she may whisper to her chief; they did not forbid
her to do <em>that</em>. Mahaska knows that she can trust her brave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah drew himself proudly up:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chief has never broken his word,” he said; “that
which Mahaska tells him in the secrecy of her lodge shall
never be whispered to the wind outside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is well,” she returned; “better even than his courage
Mahaska loves the chiefs honor; she will trust him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She may do so; he will be silent as the grass over the
graves of our fathers—let Gi-en-gwa-tah hear the queens
visions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He liked to call her by that title; his nature was too noble
for him to feel the slightest jealousy of her power, and
even the thought which had of late crossed him of his own
secondary position brought no bitterness toward her; it only
made him burn to distinguish himself by greater deeds, that
he might win for himself honors which should prove him
worthy to have been selected as her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>After a few moments’ pause she said, in the deep, impressive
tone in which she was wont to relate her visions:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska was not alone until almost dawn; all night the
voices of her spirits filled the lodge like the sighing of the
south wind; many things they told her. They are pleased
that the Fox is gone. Mahaska saw him, too, at a distance;
he could not approach her for her presence is sacred, but he
stood far off, moaning and wringing his hands, full of suffering
and misery for the trouble he tried to bring upon her. He
took with him no hunting-knife, no tomahawk, into the land
of shadow; he suffers from hunger and cold, and there are
none to help him. All the spirits say to him:  ‘thus shall it
befall those who plot against the queen whom Mineto has
given to the Senecas.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah shuddered at the picture she drew.  Mahaska
noted the effect of every word.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“They have told Mahaska that the expedition against the
Delawares shall be successful. When the young men go forth
Mahaska will hang a crimson plume in the door of her lodge
to be worn by the brave who brings her the scalp of Shewashiet.
Let Gi-en-gwa-tah take heed that no other hand than
his bears off the prize.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief murmured some unintelligible words, but she saw
by the kindling of his eyes that only the loss of his own life
would prevent his claiming the guerdon. Even in that busy moment
she had time to hope that this might be the end—that
the warriors might come back and lay the dead body of her
husband at her feet—it was to spur him to new recklessness
that she suggested the prize.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All these things they told Mahaska clearly; they showed
her a future for Gi-en-gwa-tah full of glory if he aids the
queen—ruin and desolation for him as well as for all who oppose
her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chief loves the queen,” he answered with deep feeling;
“the wishes of her heart are his own.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is well,” she said again; “then let Gi-en-gwa-tah listen
and heed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bowed his head silently and she went on:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The voice of the great prophet came after. When <em>he</em>
speaks Mahaska knows that the occasion is very solemn. He
was angry and spoke harshly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not angry with the queen?” interrupted Gi-en-gwa-tah.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never that” she replied; “he knows that Mahaska will
always obey his commands; but the people are blind and
deaf, and hard to persuade; he foresees trouble in the carrying
out of his desires; but so surely as they are not fulfilled, ruin
and woe will fall upon the Senecas and all the nations connected
with them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She watched him still with her eagle glance; it was
necessary to startle him by those warnings before she made
known her treacherous project.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What said the prophet?” demanded Gi-en-gwa-tah.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He says the people have followed foolish counselors; Mahaska
must set them right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They will hear the voice of their queen,” returned the
chief; “they know how the prophet loves her.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“But the prophet does not love the French nation,” she
exclaimed, quickly; “he says they are like jays, rich in bright
colors, but with many tongues and full of lies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah looked at her in trouble and astonishment,
but did not reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Nations have been deceived; the French chiefs do not
mean fairly by them; they will let the Iroquois fight their battles,
and when they are weakened will take away their lands.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The French chiefs have kept their word with the Nations,”
returned Gi-en-gwa-tah; “did Mahaska hear the prophet
aright?”</p>

<p class='c009'>A thrill of anger burned in her breast; the opposition which
she had feared was rising up in the very outset.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Gi-en-gwa-tah listen,” she said, calmly; “he only sees
the faces of the French chiefs, the prophet looks into their
hearts. The pale-faces will have long and bloody wars between
themselves; the Indians have no cause to love either;
if they are wise they will join the side which is to prove the
most powerful and where they have not already been cheated
by false promises.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Six Nations must keep their pledge,” exclaimed the
chief; “they have smoked the pipe of peace with the French
leaders; they have taken his presents; they would be dogs if
they deserted him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The English chiefs are very rich,” said Mahaska; “they
would give great sums to the Senecas; they are very powerful
and will finally drive the French across the great waters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah has found the French men brave,” he replied,
firmly; “they fight like great warriors; they will not
be conquered nor driven away.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska could hardly restrain a movement of impatience,
but she controlled herself; even her tutored face gave no sign
of the tempest which had begun to rage within.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska does not speak her own words,” she said, warningly;
“Gi-en-gwa-tah contradicts the words of the prophet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Mahaska says he did not speak clearly; may she not
be mistaken?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only yesterday the chief saw the cloud-chariot which
would have borne Mahaska away from her people forever
if they had refused her wishes; does he doubt her <em>already</em>?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“Gi-en-gwa-tah does not doubt; he only asks her to listen
well to the voices of her spirits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She listens; she repeats their words; Mahaska can not
twist them to please Gi-en-gwa-tah.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no,” he said, quickly; “Mahaska knows that the chief
does not wish that. Speak, Mahaska; the prophet did not
bid you tell the Nations to forsake the French?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The question took her by surprise; she was not prepared
to make a direct avowal, and remained silent for a time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was bid to speak as I have,” she said; “this is not the
season for more words; by the time the chiefs return, Mahaska
will see clearly and will then tell Gi-en-gwa-tah all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She dropped the subject and began speaking of other
things, artfully making allusions to the English, their growing
power, and comparing their magnificent presents to their allies
with the meager gifts which the French had bestowed upon
the tribes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah was greatly disturbed by all that she had
said, and left the lodge to complete his preparations for departure.
He believed that Mahaska would yet be convinced
of the good faith of the French. Certainly in his opinion,
nothing, not even warnings from higher people, could warrant
his nation in throwing aside their pacific treaty with them unless
some act of faithlessness should render them justified in
so doing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go,” muttered Mahaska, as he disappeared; “not long
will I argue and barter with that fastidious savage; my foot
once on his neck and I can throw off these irksome disguises,
and free myself of him forever—fool! blind fool, that he is!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stamped upon the ground as if already feeling her victim
beneath it; a spasm of fury swept over her features, so
darkening and distorting them that the face no longer seemed
the same which had looked so smilingly at the deluded chief.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV.<br> <span class='c007'>THE TEST OF HONOR.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>On the morning appointed, the great body of warriors departed
upon their expedition, commanded by Gi-en-gwa-tah,
who already had won so much distinction by his courage and
success.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the threshold of her lodge Queen Mahaska saw them
file past her. She stood there, surrounded by the old chiefs,
and something in the scene suggested to her mind, stored
with the records of olden times, the descriptions she had read
of armies in the middle ages, going forth to vindicate the
cause of beauty. She smiled bitterly as the conceit passed
through her thoughts, then she took a long crimson feather
from her coronet, and wove it among the boughs drooping
over the door of the lodge. It was a sign they all understood:
the warrior who returned with the bloody trophy she
had demanded, could claim the crimson plume.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the band had disappeared, the people returned to
their usual indolence, and Mahaska was left to the solitude of
her lodge.</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c009'>A week passed, but there was no intelligence from the absent
warriors. The people began to look for their return, but
Mahaska asked no questions and betrayed no interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>At last a swift runner brought back the expected news that
the Delawares had been defeated—their chief slain. The
shouts of the Indians penetrated to the apartment where Mahaska
was seated; she knew what they portended, but did
not move. An old Indian woman, who waited upon her,
swept back the draperies hastily, and looked in; but Mahaska
did not appear to notice her presence, and she retreated without
a word.</p>

<p class='c009'>There she sat and waited; it mattered nothing to her upon
whom the victory had fallen, so long as her husband was
alive. He must henceforth be no stumbling-block in her path.
She would permit nothing to mar her plans.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>At length the curtains were again swept back, and the
mother of her husband appeared at the opening.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chiefs await Queen Mahaska,” she said, as her old
face lit up with animation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska rose and passed into the outer apartment, where
several of the chiefs were standing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The people shout the name of our young chief,” said Upepah;
“double-tongued Shewashiet will speak no more lies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is well,” she answered, briefly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The young brave has earned a right to the chieftainship
of his tribe. Mahaska is his prophet,” continued the old
warrior.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The crimson feather hangs over the door of Mahaska’s
lodge,” she answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the sign of a united power,” replied the warrior.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska will rejoice when she sees the chief whose hand
will take down the plume she fastened among the leaves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is Gi-en-gwa-tah’s, then.” The chief retired with mingled
feelings of disappointment at her want of eagerness, and
admiration for the pride which filled her manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska had been in no haste to know the name of the
chief who had gained her lasting hate by fulfilling her behest.
Never a warrior brought home a trophy from the war-path
so dangerous and full of retribution to himself as would be
Shewashiet’s scalp; never a young brave snatched a token
from maiden’s hand so full of evil and death. The venom
of the rattlesnake would not be more fatal than the doom it
portended, for Mahaska was resolved to have <em>no</em> partner in
her greatness.</p>

<p class='c009'>The afternoon passed; an eager crowd went out to meet
the expected band. Mahaska put aside her reflections to
play her part in the scene before her. She knew well the
effect that any thing attractive to the eye produced upon the
savages, and never neglected an opportunity to essay it; she
did not now, even in the repulsion and scorn with which her
mind dwelt upon the nearing destiny before her, forget the
picturesque and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c009'>The furs hung before the opening of the lodge were thrown
back, and Mahaska seated herself there, richly attired, and
surrounded by the old chiefs. They all waited in silence, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>much impressed by her appearance and state that they could
only watch her in mute wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the shouts of the people went up; the chiefs leaned
eagerly forward; the throng pressed more eagerly in advance;
but Mahaska sat there immovable as before. The band of
warriors emerged from the forest; the leader urged on his
horse with all speed, and rode furiously toward the lodge.
The rest of the warriors remained at a little distance; a
breathless silence crept over the people, while every eye was
turned upon Mahaska. She had not moved—had not even
looked up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her young husband sprung from his horse—stood upon
the threshold of the lodge and grasped the crimson plume.
Mahaska raised her eyes as he took from his belt a scalp and
extended it toward her, the long hair fluttering in the wind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah brings the queen his gift,” he said, in a
voice trembling with emotion; “will she take it from his
hand?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She reached forth that slender, delicate hand, grasped the
gory trophy, held it aloft, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“So perish all our enemies!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The throng answered with exultant exclamations. The
young chief stood before her, holding the crimson feather in
his hand, unable to control the eagerness which shook his
frame. Mahaska turned toward the group of old men about
her:</p>

<p class='c009'> “The chiefs behold,” she said; “the Great Spirit has favored
Gi-en-gwa-tah! So shall it be with all who obey Mahaska,
and who seek to work her bidding out of love.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She stood smiling up in the face of her husband, while
many a murderous thought seethed through her brain. The
delicate fingers that held the scalp quivered with eagerness
to hold a yet dearer trophy, which, once in her grasp, would
leave her pathway unfettered.</p>

<p class='c009'>The warriors left the two standing on the threshold of
their lodge, and marched away toward the village, raising a
shout of triumph that echoed across the lake, and died like a
wind in the depths of the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Mahaska glad that her chief won her prize?” he asked,
holding up the graceful feather.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Does not Gi-en-gwa-tah know her heart?” she asked.
“Mahaska can not make vows and use childish words like
common women; she is set apart from them by a sacred
spell; let Gi-en-gwa-tah be content that she sits beside him in
his lodge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chief’s heart has been lonely without her,” he said,
earnestly; “he knows her to be a great prophetess, but, to
his love she is a woman, and he pines for her presence as he
would for the sunshine during a long night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was in no mood for listening to such words; she had
been buoying herself up with false hopes too long not to feel
their disappointment; it was enough to have the misery of
seeing him return a victor without being obliged to submit to
evidences of his affection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen has many things on her mind,” she said, coldly;
“she can not talk with Gi-en-gwa-tah now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked at her in sorrowful surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Mahaska in haste to quit the chief?” he asked. “He
has been gone so many days, and she sends him from her
now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah must pay the penalty of his greatness,” she
said; “is there a chief in the tribe that would not obey Mahaska’s
wishes to be in his place? Mahaska hears voices—she
must obey them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Without another word she left him alone, so full of sad
thoughts after the triumph he had expected, that his heart
was chilled to the core.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V.<br> <span class='c007'>THE PALACE AND ITS FURNITURE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The chief’s love for his wife was a feeling so powerful that
all others had fallen into insignificance beside it. To please
and gratify her were the highest wishes he had, and, in spite
of her white blood, her education, she might well have been
proud of his love.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>His personal advantages were very great; he was one of
the handsomest men in the tribe, a bold, manly type of beauty,
and had always been regarded as the most prominent among
the young chiefs. He was open and honest to a degree astonishing
in an Indian, with a regard for his word which no
temptation could have forced him to break, his whole character
presenting a strange contrast to that of Mahaska, whose
highest action was dictated by craft, and whose promises were
only meant to deceive.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she first came among them she had ordered the
building of a stone mansion, by the lake, which she styled
her palace, and had carried out her plans in spite of all difficulties.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where should the queen live?” she asked. “Is Mahaska
a squaw that Gi-en-gwa-tah should give her a bark wigwam?
Yonder by the lake stands the unfinished walls of her lodge;
the queen will not have full faith in the chief until he urges
on her wishes and makes his lazy people toil to complete it.”
She would have no further discussion, and anxious to gratify
her the chief urged on the work with new zeal and haste, and
every morning when Mahaska looked out upon it, she could
see her new mansion assuming habitable shape. At length
the palace, as she loved to call it, was completed—the wonder
and admiration of the whole tribe, who had labored so faithfully
in its construction.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was now autumn; the forest wore the latest glory of its
gorgeous coloring. Already the leaves lay strewn like a rich
carpet about the paths of the wilderness; the wind caught a
deeper and more mournful tone, but the air was still balmy
and soft, for the sunlight lay warm and pleasant over the
beautiful lake. It seemed as if the soft autumn weather was
lingering to the latest moment, unwilling to yield the last
traces of its beauty to the chill embrace and desolation of
winter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Meanwhile Mahaska was floating on toward the full tide of
success in her schemes; her control over the people increased
a manner that was magical, and the brave Gi-en-gwa-tah,
with all his bravery, was chief among her adherents and her
servitors. The nature this untutored savage appeared
lifted out of itself by the love which filled his heart; reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>did not control his feelings, for Mahaska, as a woman, was so
entirely set apart from all other women that reverence and
worship appeared her due. She was satisfied with her influence
over him, but her quick perception perceived one fact—if
the fulfillment of her wishes stood between him and that
which his stern sense of honor considered just, she was certain
to meet the most resolute opposition in her husband.
When that reflection occurred, the repulsion which she had
from the first harbored toward the chief, gained strength.
But there was no trace of these feelings in her manner; she
grew more gentle and considerate, and fairly dizzied his strong
senses with the numberless fascinations she cast about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah was sorely troubled in his mind concerning
the manner in which the new dwelling was to be arranged.
He had visited Quebec, seen luxurious dwellings in several
other cities, and knew what Mahaska had a right to expect;
but the attainment of his wishes was not easily reached. He
consulted with his intimate friends, and they held long conversations,
which would have amused and astonished those
accustomed only to the stern, hard side of the Indian character.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah owned a rich store of furs and sundry valuables
which he had received from white traders in return for
skins, and it was decided between the two that these should
go toward the adornment of the mansion, although the chief
was, by no means, satisfied, and his old mother, Meme, who
had now become an inmate of his lodge, according to the
usage of the tribe, took a true feminine delight in adding to
his perplexities. She had promised to keep his secret faithfully,
and above all not to reveal to Mahaska the doubts which
disturbed his mind; but the old woman soon found an excuse
for informing her son’s wife of every word he had said the
first time they were alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah fears that Mahaska will pine for the luxuries
that the pale-faces love,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen has a right to live like a sovereign,” she answered;
“would they have her sit on the ground like a squaw
of burthen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah has many furs; he will make cushions for
Mahaska; the fire-places in her great lodge would each hold
a wigwam.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“The Great Spirit will send all that the queen needs,” said
Mahaska.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old woman looked at her wonderingly. She firmly
believed in the supernatural destiny of her new-found daughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Great Spirit will send power and victories,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He will also send all that Mahaska requires,” persisted
Mahaska. “Mahaska has her visions; they warn her
of all that will happen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And will there come gifts like those of the governor-chief?”
she asked, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska made a quick gesture; any allusion to her old life
always enraged her—the mention of a single name linked
with the past shook her self-control to its center.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah’s mother babbles like a blind squaw,” she
said, contemptuously; “is she growing a child again?” then
she added, quickly; “let Gi-en-gwa-tah cease to trouble his
mind. Such gifts as he has let him carry into the queen’s
palace; when the time arrives all that she wishes will follow.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman could not restrain her curiosity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When were these things promised to Mahaska?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it for Meme to question concerning the revelation of
the Great Spirit?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska speaks wisely,” she replied; “Meme will seek to
learn no more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She shall see the palace blossom like the wilderness in
summer,” said Mahaska; “it shall become sacred among the
Nations because it will be filled with gifts from the Manitou.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“May Meme repeat these things to Gi-en-gwa-tah?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let her tell him all; what the queen has been promised
shall come to pass before he leads her to the dwelling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the most bewildering thing that had ever happened
to the old woman—she could not in the least comprehend it;
but she placed the utmost faith in Mahaska’s words and waited
patiently for their fulfillment.</p>

<p class='c009'>She went back to the chief, and, without revealing her betrayal
of his confidence, told him of Mahaska’s words, which
filled his mind with wonder equal to her own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gradually it crept about among the people that the
Spirit had promised to send rich gifts to their queen, and they
regarded her with new awe and reverence.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>There was more truth in the queen’s assertion concerning
the promised gifts than appeared probable; although she certainly
did not base her expectations upon any supernatural
agency. She was left free in her actions; the only person
who ever watched her movements was Gi-en-gwa-tah, and he
did it only from the restlessness of his great affection. She
was accustomed to take long rides in solitude—to row upon
the lake night or day; but she did not fail to give even these
relaxations a mysterious signification. She told the Indians
that spirit-voices spoke to her, and in the wind that rocked
her canoe upon the moonlit waters she held communion with
the shade of her ancestor, the great prophet, Nemono. By
these means she secured herself against intrusion; even Gi-en-gwa-tah
would not have ventured to watch her movements
at such times, for fear of bringing the anger of the Manitou
upon himself by intruding upon those religious rites which he
had been taught to venerate.</p>

<p class='c009'>We have spoken of the plot which from the first had been
forming in her mind to win the Six Nations from their alliance
with the French, and carry their power over to the English
in the warfare then imminent. This desire had been seconded
in the most unexpected manner, while she was revolving
means for obtaining communication with the English leaders.
Her advent among the Indians already was a subject of
much curiosity with the whites, and a politic English Governor
determined to do every thing in his power to win her good
offices in bringing to his side the assistance of the Indian
tribes then pledged to the interests of the French.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska had gone out to ride in the forest; she was miles
beyond the Indian village, galloping wildly along, feeling a
sort of relief in the swift pace and freedom from all human
observation. Suddenly a form started up before her in the
path; she checked her horse and instinctively her right hand
clenched the tomahawk which she always carried in her girdle,
although she supposed it to be some one of her own tribe who
had wandered there upon a hunting expedition. The savage,
made signs of friendly greeting and approached her horse.
As he drew near she recognized a half-breed whom she had
known at Quebec—a man afterward discovered to be an English
spy, but who had escaped punishment by a dextrous flight.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“Rene,” she called in French; “Rene.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bounded toward her, and with elaborate signs of respect
began pouring forth a volley of delight at seeing her again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What brings you here?” she asked, checking his compliments.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The desire to see Mahaska once more,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled, then darted a stern glance at him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are an English spy,” she said; “the Indians are
friendly with the French; have you come to carry back information
concerning their movements?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, lady; the Virgin is my witness, no.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you were discovered and recognized they would put
you to death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the queen would protect me; you would not let them
harm poor Rene,” he said, humbly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why should I interfere? What interest can I have in your
life?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I have endangered it in seeking you,” he replied;
“you would not allow an humble messenger to be molested.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You were seeking <em>me</em>?” she repeated.</p>

<p class='c009'>He made a gesture of assent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And a messenger, you say? From whom? What do you
want?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He drew close to her horse; she still kept her hand on the
hilt of her tomahawk, watching his movements with her eagle
glance, but evinced no fear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can I speak openly?” he almost whispered. “Is there
no one to overhear me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are quite alone; tell me your errand at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have a letter for you, lady; I was to place it in your
own hands with all secrecy. Wait—you shall see how Rene
fulfills the commands of those who employ him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He thrust his hand into his hunting-shirt and tore it open
at the breast; made a slit in the lining with his knife and
drew out a sealed package.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There it is,” he said; “it will tell you all you wish to
know.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska grasped the letter, feeling confident that in some
way this epistle would aid her schemes. She motioned the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>spy to retire, and he crept away to some distance with the
stealthy tread which had become natural to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska allowed the reins to fall upon the neck of her
well-trained steed, and broke the seal of the letter. Still she
did not relinquish her vigilance; her quick ear caught the least
movement of the half-breed as if it were some artfully-spread
snare she was quite ready to meet. But the instant her eyes
fell upon the writing her suspicions vanished, for she recognized
the signature of the English Governor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The letter was long and artfully written, making it appear
for her interest to bring the Indians over to the English.
There were liberal promises of gifts and money—messengers
were waiting her answer to set forth at once to consult with
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska folded up the letter and concealed it in her bosom.
For a few moments she yielded herself to the reflections
called up by this new opening for her schemes of vengeance.
She, however, soon aroused herself and turned toward the
half-breed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you come to my lodge to-night for the answer?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, lady.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if you are seen you will be scalped before I can interpose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rene can skulk like a fox,” he said; “there is no danger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then come after midnight; you will find me at the entrance
and will carry the letter I shall give you to the English
Governor without loss of time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bowed in silence; she gathered up the reins and galloped
swiftly back toward the village.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI.<br> <span class='c007'>THE EMBASSY AND THE MIRACLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was a beautiful night, several weeks after the interview
with Rene, in the wood. The moon was full, the air singularly
pleasant and soft, and the whole scene so full of tranquil
beauty, in spite of its wildness, that it seemed impossible it
should not bring repose to the most troubled heart. On the
morrow Gi-en-gwa-tah was to lead Queen Mahaska to her new
mansion, and the whole village had retired early to rest in
anticipation of the coming festivities, given in honor of the
completion of the royal structure.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the day, old Meme had stolen up to the rise of
ground close by the lake where the stone dwelling stood, to
see if Mahaska’s words had been fulfilled. She went through
the different rooms, but there was nothing to be seen except
the gifts which the Indian chief, her son, had brought there.
The old woman was greatly disappointed, but said nothing,
and for the rest of the day the dwelling was left deserted and
silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska had signified to her that, on that night, she must
be left alone; she was going out upon the lake to receive the
last instructions of the spirits who made her wise with their
counsels.</p>

<p class='c009'>This information crept among the tribe, and every one
avoided approaching her lodge after nightfall. Hence she was
left to the undisturbed freedom which she desired.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska sat quietly in her lodge till the hands of a little
watch she always carried pointed to midnight; then she rose,
wrapped her mantle about her, and passed into the open air.
She walked rapidly down to the shore of the lake, where her
canoe was moored—a light, graceful bark, which Gi-en-gwa-tah
had constructed for her with unusual elegance and care.
Seating herself in the canoe, she paddled noiselessly up the
lake.</p>

<p class='c009'>About half a mile beyond her new palace there was a high
bluff, projecting over the waters and crowned with lofty trees.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>That was the point of her destination. As she neared this
spot she ceased paddling, and sent a low whistle, like the cry
of a bird, across the water. It was answered by a similar
sound; then she rowed rapidly toward the cliff.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the boat approached the shore, she saw canoes drawn
up under the shadow of the ledge, and a little knot of men
stood awaiting her arrival.</p>

<p class='c009'>With one vigorous sweep she sent her canoe on the beach,
rose slowly, gathered her mantle about her, and stepped on
shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two of the men came forward to meet her; in the third
her quick glance recognized the half-breed. The pair who
awaited her were both young men still, but in spite of the
hunting-shirts and leggins, there was an air of high-breeding
and command about them which betrayed their rank.</p>

<p class='c009'>They greeted Mahaska with a courteous salutation, and
she could see the surprise they felt at her appearance as she
appeared so suddenly before them in the soft moonlight, in
the full power of her grace and loveliness. They were astounded
by her beauty, and soon were enchanted with her
graces.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe I have the pleasure of addressing Colonel St.
Clair and Captain Stuart,” she said, in her most winning
voice, speaking in English, and with an ease which only perfect
familiarity with the language could have given.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each bowed in turn as his name was mentioned, and she
added, lightly, though not abating an inch of her state:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am grieved that I should have been forced to receive
you so unceremoniously, gentlemen; one day I shall hope to
greet you with the distinction such guests deserve. At present
we meet almost as conspirators.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are only too much honored, lady, by your consenting
to meet us at all,” said Colonel St. Clair.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked keenly at him; the tone was honest and sincere.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your General, then, received my answer to his letter
without delay?” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He did, madam, and dispatched us on the instant to arrange
with you concerning a variety of matters which must
be considered should your plans succeed. He regretted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>exceedingly that he could not make this visit in person, and
thus secure himself the pleasure of an interview with one of
whom report speaks such marvels, and yet falls so far short
of the reality.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should have been most happy to receive his visit” Mahaska
replied; “it will be a pleasure in anticipation. I owe
him many thanks for making his absence less felt by the
choice he made of his embassadors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a little further exchange of compliments, and
then they entered upon the business which brought them
there. The two officers were refined, nobly-born men, accustomed
to association with those of high birth, but never,
even among royalty, had they met more polished grace and
courtesy than this women exhibited, standing alone in the
wilderness. Then the vigor and keenness of her intellect
was felt in the propositions she laid down, and her woman’s
vanity taught her when and how to wander from the theme,
and give an opportunity to display glimpses of her wonderful
information, and of the sparkling wit of which she
was capable. They remained conversing for a long time;
at last it was necessary that the conference should be broken
up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our General has ventured to send with us a few offerings
as a token of his friendship and esteem,” said St. Clair, “which
he begged me to present to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska’s keen eyes had taken note of the three heavily
loaded boats, and understood that the artful suggestions in her
letter had been acted upon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whatever they may be,” she said, “they will prove welcome,
as a friendly recognition from your brave General.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are in a little perplexity as to the means of disposing
of them,” said St. Clair, laughing, and yet feeling as much
embarrassed as if she had not been half Indian, and standing
in the depths of her native wilderness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can trust no one as yet,” she answered. “The whole
transaction must remain a secret, or I would send men here
to take them to my home.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can we not do it, madam?” he asked; “can we not row
over to it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; it is not far and stands almost upon the shore.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>She pointed to the stone front of her dwelling, which shone
out grandly in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is hardly gracious to make you perform such an office,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It becomes an honor in your service,” he replied; “besides,
we have our boatmen below.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, since you are so kind, I will go on in advance and
show you the way,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>They conducted her to her canoe, and set rapidly off in the
wake of silver that flashed under her paddles.</p>

<p class='c009'>They landed on the shore, close by one of the entrances to
her mansion, and began unloading the countless packages
which crowded the boats. Mahaska stood by, apologizing
gracefully, but in her heart she was delighted at forcing these
two proud pale-faces to superintend work which should have
belonged to the meanest workmen—even in so slight a thing,
it was a pleasure to humble any of the hated race.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska threw open the doors, and ushered them into her
dwelling. All manner of gifts which could conduce to her
comfort were soon crowded into the rooms: rich coverings;
piles of cushions; silken draperies; costly sets of china and
plate—every thing which it had been possible to bring that
could be expected to afford gratification, was suddenly thrown
from the midst of luxury and refinement into the wildness of
savage life. Then St. Clair drew from his breast a casket and
placed it in her hands. She raised the lid, and the precious
stones it contained flashed in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled with keen satisfaction. She might have endured
bare floors, coarse viands, all the nakedness of savage
existence, but she was growing avaricious—eager to heap up
stores of gold and gems, not from a miserly feeling, but because
such treasures were tangible evidences of power.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am overwhelmed by such profusion,” she said; “there
are no thanks that could express a shadow of a return. Tell
your General, Mahaska could not be bought either by gold or
jewels; but the thoughtfulness and friendship exhibited in
the choice of his gifts have won her heart forever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He will be rejoiced to hear your message,” returned St.
Clair, “and I am sure that this alliance can be made equally
useful to both the English and yourself. Besides, the General
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>was anxious personally to open communication with a lady
already so much talked of throughout the land.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“These are early days,” said Mahaska, proudly; “let them
wait, and see what time shall bring forth. Your Governor
and I, at all events, are bound together by the closest ties
that can ever knit human hearts—mutual interests, and mutual
hate of a common enemy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They did not understand the import of her words, and
looked somewhat surprised.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our hatred for the French,” she continued, answering the
expression in their faces. “Talk of the power of love! There
is no feeling binds human beings so closely as a common
hate!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, fearful that her words and tone had revealed too
much ferocity, she hastened to speak of other things, careful
to do nothing which would send them away with an unfavorable
opinion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish I had some token to send your General,” she said;
“but, alas, what could I find in this wild domain which
would give him pleasure?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I might venture to suggest,” said St. Clair, hesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, sir?” she asked, in her sweetest voice. “Surely I
can not be so terrible that you need hesitate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you had a portrait of yourself that you would permit
me to take back to the General, it would make him a proud
and happy man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” she exclaimed, smiling still, though her voice
rung out a shade less soft, “would you have a picture of the
Indian queen that your nation might look at it and say, ‘This
is the panther of the forest?’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Madam, you wrong our gallantry and our manhood by
the doubt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Truly, I think so,” she answered. “Let me see—let me
see. I have a miniature of myself—yes, you shall send Rene
for it soon. I shall have news for you then. It is the face
of a mere girl; but, tell the Governor, when he looks at
to remember that it is a pledge of the woman’s sincerity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Many, many thanks,” returned St. Clair. “Now, madam,
permit us to take our leave. The night is wearing on, and
we have a long journey before us.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Farewell, then, gentlemen. Believe me, you have bound
me to you by this night’s work. I may one day be able to
give you a proof of my friendship.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The knowledge that we possess it is good fortune enough,”
they answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>They bent over the hand she extended, and, with more
words of courtesy, passed out of her presence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska stood in the hall where she had parted from her
visitors, till the softly-handled oars died away on the lake.
Then, without more delay, she began, by the light of the
moon which filled the apartment with its radiance, to complete
the task which lay before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah had instructed the Indians to make chairs
and sofas for the new dwelling—rough seats of hewn wood;
but Mahaska speedily hid their uncouthness with the rich
cushions the Englishmen had brought. She arranged Gi-en-gwa-tah’s
furs with excellent taste, draped the windows, and
before the day broke, had restored every thing to order, and
wrought a transformation so complete in the mansion that it
seemed like the work of magic.</p>

<p class='c009'>When all was prepared, she sought her canoe and rowed
back to her lodge, to await the influence of her night’s work.</p>

<p class='c009'>Early in the morning Mahaska was aroused by a crowd of
women, who had left their wigwams early in order to witness
the miracle which Gi-en-gwa-tah’s mother had whispered
abroad as likely to follow Mahaska’s removal to her stone
house. They found the young chief preparing Mahaska’s
canoe for an early sail to the stately residence. His wife had
said nothing to him about her hopes of spiritual assistance in
beautifying her residence; and, though he had heard the rumor,
he deemed it only female gossip, which prevailed in that
remote Indian village just as actively as it is to be found in
our cities of the present day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun was up, and cresting all the little wavelets on the
lake with golden flashes, when Mahaska appeared in the door
of her lodge. The women gathered around her, clamorous
for information regarding her night-visions. She looked fresh
and blooming as if she had spent the whole night in healthful
slumber.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska had beautiful dreams,” she said, smiling. “All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>night the prophet whispered great things in her ear. She is
glad at heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah came up while she was speaking; he had
cushioned her canoe with furs and lined it with scarlet cloth
which fell over its edges like a fringe. It looked like a cradle
on the soft swell of the waters, inviting her to enter. In his
rude way, Gi-en-gwa-tah had furnished his rude dwelling, but
he felt anxious, and dissatisfied with the effect. Could he
have carpeted the floor with ermine, and made her couches
of ebony, the generous savage would have done it. Indeed,
the furs which he had lavished on her new home would have
almost bought the furnishing of a palace; but their value was
nothing to him so long as they remained only a type of savage
life.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Mahaska had no misgivings. Bright, cheerful and
queenly, she stepped into the canoe and sat down among the
furs, beautiful as Cleopatra in her barge. Gi-en-gwa-tah
placed himself opposite her in the little craft, and, followed
by a dozen other canoes, crossed to the slope of land on which
the stone mansion was built. There a crowd met them—chiefs,
warriors, and women—all forming a picturesque escort
to the young couple as they left the canoe and walked up to
the front entrance.</p>

<p class='c009'>The door was opened by Gi-en-gwa-tah’s mother, who uttered
a cry of delighted surprise as she crossed the threshold.
Mahaska entered smiling, but the young chief paused in the
first room, mute with astonishment. The walls, bare and
black the night before, were now covered with brilliant hangings,
which fell from light, gilded cornices; small carpets
covered the center of the floor, and fur rugs were scattered
about; the rude tables were overspread with gorgeously-wrought
covers, and on the mantel were tall silver candlesticks,
from which tapers of tinted wax beamed with a rich
promise of light.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska turned to her husband, smiling:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mineto is good; he has sent his spirits to work for us in
the night. This is not our palace, but a great medicine-lodge
which we are to inhabit for the good of our people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah could not speak: surprise had struck him
dumb.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Mahaska looked around the room with an air of queenly
satisfaction. A great oaken chest, clamped with brass, stood
in the room. She lifted the lid, revealing a glittering store of
beads, knives, gorgeous stuffs and embroidered blankets. She
filled her arms with these things and went forth among the
people on the lawn, to whom she distributed them generously,
buying golden opinions with every lift of her hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is the great Mineto who sends them to his chosen
tribe; see what care he takes of my people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The savages gave their simple hearts to this woman, whose
powers they considered divine.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='c007'>THE FIRST STORM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Some new trouble had again broken out with a neighboring
tribe, and Gi-en-gwa-tah went with a band of warriors to desolate
their territory.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska, ever on the alert, perceived that a favorable moment
had arrived for bringing the great body of chiefs to her
views in regard to the English alliance. She had been craftily
at work for weeks, but now she intended to urge her cause
with boldness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Delegates from several of the Six Nations chanced to be
there, and that, added to the absence of Gi-en-gwa-tah, rendered
the time a favorable one for acting promptly. She
feared the honest rectitude of the chief, and knew that he
would have great influence among the people; so she trusted
to having matters so far settled before his return that any opposition
on his part would prove useless.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old chiefs were debating about the council-fire upon
some unimportant matter. She sent them word, by one of
her honorary body-guard, that she was coming to hold a consultation.
Mahaska had appropriated to herself a guard of
one hundred warriors, to be always at her command. When
she wished to go upon the war-path the band swelled to twice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>that number, and, during all the after years of her life, it was
a mark of high distinction to be chosen a member of that
body.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had not yet gone personally into battle, though the
time came when there was no carnage in which she did not
take part—when for years and years her very name was a
sickening terror among the whites, and the sight of one of the
white queen’s private guard was a signal for coming slaughter
which knew neither distinction nor mercy.</p>

<p class='c009'>She presented herself among the chiefs, who received her
with all possible honor, and waited to hear her errand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Queen Mahaska’s sleep has been troubled for many nights,”
she said; “her visions have been vague and indistinct; but,
of late, her anchor, the prophet Nemono, has spoken clearly
to her again, and bid her speak words of wisdom to the
chiefs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They bowed their heads, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will hear the words of the great prophet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“For many, many moons,” continued Mahaska, “the Six
Nations have been friends with the French; they have aided
them in their wars, and have given their young men to die for
them; they have helped them to preserve power and dominion
to which they had no right. Is it not true? Let the chiefs
answer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is true,” they said with one voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what have the French done in return for the red-men?”
she went on, her voice deepening and her form dilating with
new majesty. “They have offered many promises, but Mahaska
can find no trace of their fulfillment. They have taken
lands which were yours; they have treated your young men
harshly; they have refused to buy your furs at honest prices—was
this the conduct of <em>friends</em>? They laugh at you;
they say that the chiefs are old squaws to be cheated with
presents of tobacco and beads. Mahaska has dwelt among
them; she knows their thoughts. They will spurn you like
dogs when you have worked their bidding! Have the Six
Nations no warriors that they submit to such insults?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She hurried on with a passionate speech which carried her
hearers blindly along the stream of her eloquence. She urged
upon them the advantages of an alliance with the English,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>assuring them that it was desired by the prophet. She threatened
them with the anger of the Great Spirit if they refused
to obey, and, at length, worked them up to a pitch of enthusiasm
which rendered them ready and willing to concede to
her desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>Three chiefs were appointed as a delegation to confer with
the English Governor, from whom Mahaska had received such
offers of friendship. She sent by them letters of instruction
to the British authorities, and when every thing was done that
was necessary to her plans she awaited Gi-en-gwa-tah’s return
with composure, satisfied that it was then too late for him to
demur to her schemes with any success.</p>

<p class='c009'>The war-party came back at last, and when Gi-en-gwa-tah
learned what had happened during his absence he was greatly
troubled, and burning with indignation. He called a council at
once, and made a speech full of feeling and honor to the
chiefs, which was coldly received. During his absence Mahaska
quietly and subtly had done much to undermine his influence;
he was, therefore, totally at a loss to account for the
change he perceived among his people.</p>

<p class='c009'>He sought the queen with his mind full of bitterness. She
understood these signs of discontent the moment she looked
in his face, and said, coldly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah brings back more frowns than scalps from
the war-path.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The cutting sarcasm increased his irritation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen has done an evil thing,” he said, gloomily;
“she has listened to the voice of lying spirits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska sprung to her feet in sudden fury. She had grown
so accustomed to undisputed sway that even the slightest opposition
roused her to terrible passion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who comes into Mahaska’s presence with false words?”
she cried. “Has Gi-en-gwa-tah drank too much fire-water on
his bloodless war-path that he enters here with such folly on
his tongue?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah speaks wisely,” he answered, with quiet
dignity. “The French are our brothers; Mahaska should not
have urged the chiefs to break their long-respected pledge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Gi-en-gwa-tah to come between the queen and her
dreams?” she demanded. “Mahaska hears the words of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>wisdom from the lips of the great prophet—can Gi-en-gwa-tah
translate them better than she? Let him beware how he
opposes the wishes of the Manitou—how he brings shame on
Mahaska!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief looked in astonishment at the rage in her countenance—she
was beginning to drop the mask which she had
worn since their marriage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The red-men have no complaint to make against the
French,” he urged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Gi-en-gwa-tah go and sew wampum with the squaws!”
she insolently exclaimed. “He has not the spirit of a chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief’s haughty spirit rose to meet her own at this insult,
and he answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen speaks biting words because she is a woman.
Gi-en-gwa-tah can not fling them back in return.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her rage kindled more hotly at the response, and she exclaimed,
in a low, terrible voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah’s feet are on hollow ground—let him take
heed lest it give way under him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does Mahaska mean?” he demanded, quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That the people will cease to be the slaves of the false-tongued
French; that, if Gi-en-gwa-tah does not join the
other chiefs, he will lose caste in the tribe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah will not consent to a wrong,” he said; “he
will tell the people that they are deceived.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Mahaska will go among them and say: ‘Regard
that man—you desired him to be the husband of the queen
whom you have reverenced and obeyed; he comes to you and
says that her visions are false—her words those of lying
spirits!’ Follow me to the council-fire—speak, and Mahaska
will answer; <em>come</em>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She made a movement as if to rush away at once, but the
chief did not move. His head sunk upon his breast—his face
was dark with sorrowful thoughts. The idea of strife between
himself and his idolized wife was terrible to him; he
was perplexed and sorely at a loss how to act. He could not
bear to think that this injustice should go on until the Six
Nations had betrayed their trust, and proved themselves false
to their pledges; yet, at the same time, it cut him to the heart
to act in opposition to Mahaska’s wishes. He was too simple
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>minded and too full of his first love for her to think, as yet,
that she could wittingly be acting a treacherous part. He had
felt the most implicit faith in her prophesies. It was not her
truth he suspected, but he feared that she had been deceived
by some false dream-spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why does not Gi-en-gwa-tah follow?” cried Mahaska,
tauntingly. “Let him go among the people and tell them
that their queen is a child—that she deceives herself and
them—why does he not come?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah only asks his wife to reflect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska’s thoughts are like the flight of an eagle,” she
interrupted; “and they fly alway toward the sun—Gi-en-gwa-tah’s
thoughts are like owls that doze while others act.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was greatly irritated by her open contempt and unrestrained
sarcasm, but he still answered with grave dignity that
expressed far more sorrow than anger.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When the chiefs return from their mission we will hold
council again,” he said; “bitter words will not bring wisdom
either to Gi-en-gwa-tah or the queen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Six Nations shall obey Mahaska,” cried the infuriated
woman, cold and terrible in her rage; “sorrow and desolation
shall smite him who opposes her! The race of Gi-en-gwa-tah
shall become extinct—the children he hopes for, to be
sunshine in his old age, shall rise up to curse him. Let him
beware; he struggles against the Great Spirit; he will be uprooted
like a pine tree smitten by the tempest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked a heathen prophetess inspired by her deity; her
hands were outstretched, her form erect, her eyes blazing with
passion. In spite of his firmness the chief was greatly troubled
by her words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska’s heart has gone away from the chief,” he said,
mournfully.</p>

<p class='c009'>Words of deeper scorn rose to her lips. Her first impulse
was to rush forth among the people, denounce him as a traitor
and a coward and rouse all their fury against him. But she
checked herself; it was better to wait. The people’s attachment
to him was very great, and she might injure her own
influence by too sudden action.</p>

<p class='c009'>She therefore changed her demeanor; assumed a kindlier
air; sat down by him and conversed more quietly—using all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>her arts to blind his clear judgment—appealing to his love—exercising
unmercifully her great control over his mind; but
through it all, the honest dictates of his soul broke through
and through her schemes, and, in spite of the pleadings of
his heart, refused to be convinced.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII.<br> <span class='c007'>THE EMBASSADRESS AND THE MOTHER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Before the winter set in Mahaska conceived the project of
making a visit around among the several powerful tribes constituting
the Six Nations, hoping by the influence of her presence
to increase still more her power and to aid the furtherance
of the ambitious projects which had formed in her wily
brain. She was accompanied on her journey by Gi-en-gwa-tah
and several of the principal chiefs, escorted by her body-guard,
and all the state and pomp which she commanded was
freely displayed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Among all the Nations she was received with every demonstration
of respect; all sorts of festivities were instituted in
her honor and her counsels were listened to with profound attention.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her plans in regard to the English alliance were working
well. The delegates had returned with highly favorable reports,
and Mahaska wrote to the Governor, that, come when it
might, the next struggle would see the Six Nations in alliance
with the British.</p>

<p class='c009'>She managed artfully to hold consultations with the chiefs
concerning this matter during every absence of Gi-en-gwa-tah,
and succeeded in establishing the impression that he was weak
and vacillating, at the same time that his ambition was inordinate
and could not endure to witness the success of men superior
to himself. Yet, while she was thus undermining his
future, the noble savage was aiding in every way to extend
her power. The freshness of his love came back at the sight
of her beauty and the admiration she excited, and he forgot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>entirely the glimpses he had of late caught of the terrible
spirit that lay hidden under that gracious exterior.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing could surpass the graciousness of the queen during
her journey. She knew only too well how to assume the appearance
of generosity. She made beautiful presents to the
chiefs and their wives, scattered her profuseness right and left,
and, as she quitted each tribe in succession, was followed by
the love and wonder of their untutored minds. She seemed
to them like a being suddenly descended among them from a
higher sphere. They were never weary of gazing upon her
beauty. She dazzled their eyes with her rich attire and the
costly goods which had been the price of her treachery toward
the French.</p>

<p class='c009'>The snow began to fall heavily when Mahaska returned to
her tribe and again established herself in her palace by the
Seneca lake. Her friend, the English Governor, had furnished
her with new gifts and her dwelling was now replete with
every article of comfort and luxury. She had instructed the
Indian women who performed the duties of servants in many
things which relieved her from the coarseness of savage life,
and the sumptuous table spread in her house would have
done credit to the most civilized household.</p>

<p class='c009'>A year had passed—it had swept Mahaska far into the
darkness of her new career, and left many a stain of blood
upon her soul which blotted out the last trace of her youth
forever. But a change came which, had she been a woman
of ordinary womanly instincts, would have subdued her fierce
nature. She sat in her palace crowned with the priceless
blessing of maternity. And her daring soul did soften under
its tender influence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Love for her child became for the time the one redeeming
feeling of her life, yet, like all emotions in her nature, it received
a sort of ferocity from its very strength. She pictured
to herself a grand future for her boy; he should be skilled in
all the arts and knowledge of the whites, while hatred toward
his grandfather’s race would be the only faith she impressed
upon his soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>The day her child was a month old she had made the occasion
one of high festival among the people, and she sat with
her babe upon her knees listening to the rejoicings that went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>up from the revelers without. Gi-en-gwa-tah was absent at the
birth of his child and had not yet returned, but his arrival
was daily expected. Mahaska was full of savage joy in his
absence, for the child had been all hers for a time at least.
She could not bear the idea of witnessing his love for it, and
dreaded with intense selfishness that the time might come
when her boy would give affection in return, to the brave savage
that had been forced into her life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never,” she muttered; “he is all mine. No one shall
share his love—the savage who claims him shall have no part
in my treasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying these words she pressed her lips upon the forehead
of the sleeping babe as if registering a vow, so wickedly did
she mingle evil thought with the tenderest and holiest feelings
that our human nature can possess.</p>

<p class='c009'>While she sat thus nursing her child with womanly seeming,
the door was flung open, and, with a quick, joyous tread, Gi-en-gwa-tah
entered the apartment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska started so violently that the babe was disturbed in
his slumber, and uttered a faint cry that smote her heart like
a sudden blow; and she grew inwardly furious to see the man
she so bitterly hated looking down upon her and her child
with an expression of such absorbing love, claiming participation
in her joy.</p>

<p class='c009'>He bent over her, his dark, noble features aglow with emotion,
his eyes misty with the new tenderness which overflowed
his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska—Mahaska!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He could speak no other words. He bent over her, encircling
his wife and child in his arms. She drove back the bitter
tide that surged up from her heart, and forced herself to
greet him with an appearance of pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska and her boy have been waiting for days,” she
said; “the chief has been long in returning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The days have seemed like years to Gi-en-gwa-tah,” he
answered; “he had left his heart here and was like one in the
dark till he could come back and find it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah speaks pleasantly like the south wind,” she
returned, with a smile; “he has been studying the flowery
language of the pale-faces.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“It is his heart that speaks! Mahaska has not pined because
this little flower opened its eyes to console her for the
chief’s absence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She held up the babe to his admiring gaze.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is he not brave and beautiful?” she cried.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief looked at him with a sort of wonder, not daring
even to touch his new treasure, so full of strange thoughts
which he could not fathom that he was quite speechless.
The babe awoke and looked around; his large black eyes
dwelt wonderingly on the chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See how brave he looks,” said Mahaska; “the chief will
find a great warrior in his son.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska will be happy and content now,” he said, gravely.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was so before,” replied the young mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sometime her face was sad—the wilderness was dark
and made her youth gloomy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is Mahaska’s home,” she replied; “she is among her
people and asks no more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked fondly down upon her, with a betrayal of feeling
which habit did not often permit him to reveal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The people are more drawn toward their queen than ever,”
he said; “she can stir their hearts as the wind ruffles the water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled proudly. Better than he did she understand
the power in her hands; his generous nature could not conceive
the use which she intended to make of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chief has heard that before many moons the tribe
will go out on the war-path,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>He bowed his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This time Mahaska will lead them,” she exclaimed; “she
is weary of leading the life of a squaw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen will do more wisely to stay at home and consult
with the old chiefs,” he said; “her wisdom will aid the
warriors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her eyes flashed; she laid the babe down upon her knees
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Great Spirit has warned Mahaska,” she said; “will
Gi-en-gwa-tah teach her duty after that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was silent, and she went on:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska will lead forth the warriors; the people shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>see that she is great in the battle-field as at the council-fire.
Her soul thirsts for action; she will work out brave deeds
with her own tomahawk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He attempted further expostulation, but she cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Gi-en-gwa-tah ashamed to fight by the side of a woman?
Does he think Mahaska a coward?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah loves Mahaska; he fears for her safety.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing can harm her when she is protected by the Great
Spirit,” she answered; “her enemies will flee her path like
dust before the whirlwind. The prophet has spoken, and the
queen will obey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah still looked troubled, but he had learned the
uselessness of opposition—he might as well have struggled
against an earthquake as against the power of that woman’s will.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen has much time for thought,” he said, calmly;
“she will decide wisely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She has decided! Did I not say that the prophet had
come in dreams, saying: ‘Let Mahaska lead her warriors forth
to the war-path—without her presence they will take no
scalps, but will return feeble and broken, leaving half their
number to be buried like dogs by their enemies.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Senecas have been always brave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is Mahaska to find opposition only in her own palace,
from the father of her boy?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The lightning of her eyes checked further expostulation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Mahaska decide,” he answered. “It shall be as she
says.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned from the subject, but his words rankled in her
mind. She began to believe, judging of his nature by her
own instincts, that he was jealous of her power, and could
not bear the idea of her winning new glory on the war-path.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He shall be swept aside like chaff,” she thought. “Gi-en-gwa-tah,
beware! The clouds grow black—the earth resounds
under your feet! Twice you have disputed Mahaska—attempt
it once more, and your little glory shall go out like a
feeble flame that my deeds will extinguish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief left her alone, and she remained bending ever
her babe, watching with solicitude his slightest movement, yet
all the while brooding over the dark thoughts forming in her
mind.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX.<br> <span class='c007'>ON THE WAR-PATH.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It was a beautiful spring day; the sun lay golden and
warm on Seneca lake; the forest that draped its picturesque
shore wore its freshest and most vivid green; the light breeze
that rippled the waters was fragrant with the odor of the wild
flowers and luxuriant grasses across which it had swept in its
path through the blooming wilderness. The Indian village
was in an unusual state of bustle and excitement; the women
and children were watching a party of warriors who performed
a war-dance about the smoldering council-fire; Indians
were hurrying to and fro, and every thing betokened the
approach of some important departure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the entrance of queen Mahaska’s palace stood a horse
richly caparisoned, and her body-guard, now swelled to two
hundred in number, had reined up their horses upon the
bank of the lake. The Senecas, together with one or two
other tribes belonging to the Six Nations, were going out upon
the war-path, and Mahaska had signified her intention of accompanying
them. Gi-en-gwa-tah had by no means yielded
the point in his own mind, but had been defiantly put to silence,
though his opposition had never arisen from the unworthy
feeling to which Mahaska ascribed it. Her wild ambition
and restless spirit yearned for new triumphs, for she had
exhausted all the ordinary successes of her life, and she determined
to win for herself new glory, by bearing a prominent
part in the wars in which the Indians were so frequently engaged.</p>

<p class='c009'>The hour set for their starting had arrived; a portion of
the band had gone on in advance; the rest only waited the
appearance of her guard to commence their journey. She
was bidding farewell to her child. In that moment of departure
upon her bloody errand, the one human feeling which
made her soul akin to her sex had its influence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The winter had been spent in no luxurious idleness which
would unfit her for the arduous undertaking now before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>No matter what the extreme of cold—no matter how deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the snow lay upon the ground, Mahaska had every day allotted
to herself several hours’ exercise in the open air; her aims
with the rifle had grown still more deadly, and all her habits
had grown more completely Amazonian than ever.</p>

<p class='c009'>The savages became impatient for the appearance of the
queen. Gi-en-gwa-tah had accompanied the advance guard
and the others were eager to follow. The old Indians had
come up from the village and stationed themselves near the
guard; the women and children crowded in their wake, and
all eyes were turned toward the doorway through which the
queen must issue from her dwelling. At last there was a
slight bustle within; several of the old chiefs appeared upon
the threshold, and then Mahaska came out, walking alone
with a prouder hearing than of old. She wore a dress of
some subdued but rich color, made short to exhibit the leggins
of dressed deerskin, and the elaborately wrought moccasins.
Over her left shoulder was flung a finely woven
blanket, fastened somewhat after the fashion of the togas of
the Roman women. The sleeves of her dress fell loosely
from her arms, exposing the symmetrical limb and slender hand
which gave no sign of their sinewy strength any more than a
first glance at the smiling face betrayed the murderous will
beneath. A rich coronet of feathers circled her head, fastened
in the center by a single diamond star, which flashed ominously
with every haughty movement of her person. A pair
of costly bracelets glittered on her wrists; the tomahawk thrust
in her girdle was veined and dotted with coral, as if she had
found special pleasure in the ornaments of her terrible weapon.</p>

<p class='c009'>She stood upon the threshold and addressed a few terse,
eloquent words to the people, then sprung upon her horse, and,
giving her rifle to the warrior who was to ride nearest her,
took her station at the head of her band. At a signal from
her hand they galloped off through the windings of the forest,
leaving the crowd behind watching their progress as long
as the gleam of a tomahawk, or the sound of a horse’s tread,
came back through the morning air.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was several hours before this band came up with the
main body which had halted by Gi-en-gwa-tah’s orders to
await Mahaska’s approach. He drew toward Mahaska and
saluted her with grave courtesy—the presence of the warriors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>restraining the slightest expression of affectionate solicitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If Mahaska deems it good,” he said, “the warriors will
wait here for the return of the scouts which were sent out before
the day broke.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She bowed her head carelessly, her eyes wandering over
the assembled savages as if she took pleasure in their warlike
appearance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When does the chief expect them back?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Before the sun is an hour higher.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is well; Mahaska will wait,” she replied, haughtily.</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned away from him but refused to dismount from
her horse, controlling his spirited movements with a single
touch of her hand. Gi-en-gwa-tah left his station near her
side, for a signal then sounded from the distance and the
scouts were near at hand. In a short time the chief returned
to Mahaska’s side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What news?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A party of our foes are encamped within a few hours’
march,” he answered; “they will remain there until to-morrow
as they have heard that warriors from several of the Six
Nations have joined our braves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are they waiting for more men?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They have sent back for them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And when they arrive they mean to march on to our village?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So the scouts have learned.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her face lighted up; she smiled and appeared gratified.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They shall be spared the trouble,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What does the queen desire?” asked Gi-en-gwa-tah. “It
is her first trial upon the war-path; let her tell the chief her
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the warriors rest here till the dark comes,” she replied;
“then we will march upon the encampment. Not a
man must escape. When the reinforcements arrive Mahaska
and her braves will be ready to receive them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The other chiefs who had approached near enough to hear
her answer received it with favor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How many men are encamped there?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The answer was, two or three hundred—a small force compared
to their own.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“And how many hours’ march?” she questioned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the braves start an hour before sunset they will reach
the spot by the time the enemy lie down to rest,” replied Gi-en-gwa-tah.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So be it,” she returned.</p>

<p class='c009'>She glanced at the little watch which she always carried;
there were still several hours to wait.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the queen’s tent be pitched,” she said; “she has need
to commune with the great prophet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her orders were obeyed with the alacrity which followed
her slightest wish. The tent had been one of the last gifts
of the English, and was made very comfortable by furs and
blankets. She alighted from her horse when the work of
spreading it was completed, and retired to its privacy, not even
glancing toward the chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>She remained alone there during the whole afternoon, busy
with her own thoughts—her face at times looking as dark and
terrible as if she were indeed holding communion with some
invisible presence that filled her soul with gloom.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the sound of preparation for departure struck her
ear she pushed back the curtains and stood in the entrance of
her tent ready for action. Gi-en-gwa-tah, approaching the
tent, informed her that the time indicated had arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the queen ready?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At all times ready,” she answered, in a voice intended to
be audible to those near, “to serve her people and lead them
on to victory. Mahaska’s plan is this: Gi-en-gwa-tah will
march on with his braves and surprise the sleeping camp—he
must come upon it from the front. Mahaska and her guard
will advance from the other side to surprise them when they
rush out in the confusion of a sudden attack.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The plan was arranged entirely to suit her wishes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little camp of the advancing foe lay quiet in the midnight;
the sentinels seemed to have fallen into broken sleep
by the waning fires. Suddenly a terrible war-cry aroused the
doomed band. It was too late to do more than rush wildly
to and fro and meet death in its most horrible form before
they actually realized that the enemy were upon them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Terrible yells and awful war-whoops went up in the still
air; the report of rifles, the whiz of tomahawks, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>clash of knives, made the night one scene of horror. The
brave enemy, endeavoring to collect their weakened force and
make a last stand, saw by the moonlight a woman ride furiously
into the camp followed by a mounted guard which dealt death
as they went. She rode her horse desperately down upon
them; her band followed, trampling the savages right and
left, crushing life out under their horses’ hoofs, and, as she
dealt fierce blows on each side, her clear woman’s voice joined
in that appalling battle-cry with a force and shrillness that
made itself heard above all the terrible sounds that filled the
air. When day broke the dying and dead lay piled thickly
upon the forest sward. Mahaska’s command had been obeyed—not
one of the number had escaped to warn their approaching
brethren of the fate which awaited them!</p>

<p class='c009'>When the fight was over Mahaska sprung from her horse,
still grasping the bloodstained tomahawk. A dozen scalps
hung from her saddle-bow; her face was ablaze with her
fierce passions.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And now for breakfast,” she exclaimed, with a laugh;
“the morning’s work is well done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The braves crowded about her with congratulations upon
her courage, and she listened with a smile soft and sweet as
ever woman wore at homage offered to some feminine charm.
While the Indians were removing the dead bodies and restoring
an appearance of quiet to the camp, Mahaska sat at breakfast
hidden from the terrible scene by a clump of undergrowth,
and arranging her plans for meeting the arrival of the enemy’s
expected reinforcements. Scouts came in and reported them
on the advance; before an hour elapsed they would reach the
camp.</p>

<p class='c009'>The horses were concealed in the forest—the band divided
in different portions who secreted themselves near the camp.
The bodies of the murdered sentinels were propped upright
against trees, their blankets fluttering in the wind, mocking
death with a horrible appearance of vitality.</p>

<p class='c009'>In half an hour there was no appearance of any thing unusual
having occurred in the camp. The savages were all
hidden—the bodies had been so artfully arranged that those
approaching the camp could not perceive the terrible cheat
until they were in the midst of the ambush.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Mahaska, panting like a wild animal, crouched in her covert
eager for the coming massacre—her whole senses were absorbed
in the desire for carnage which possessed her like a
demon. Peering out from her hiding-place she watched the
enemy approach. They marched on without a suspicion of
danger and soon reached the outskirts of the camp. Suddenly
before and behind sprung up the ambushed Senecas, and the
war-whoop that had drowned the death-cries of their brethren
again smote the air.</p>

<p class='c009'>The enemy, taken by surprise, fell back in confusion, while
the Senecas rushed upon them with the resistless force of a
tornado. The attacked savages however rallied and the struggle
commenced in all its horror. Everywhere in the thickest
of the strife Mahaska was to be seen, and her appearance
urged on her men to renewed exertion. Her hair had broken
loose from its confinement and streamed wildly over her
shoulders; her voice rung out clear and strong as a trumpet’s
challenge; she looked, in her fierce beauty, like some heathen
goddess inspiring the savages to unheard of massacre and
horror. Her presence filled the enemy with superstitious terror;
they could not believe that it was a woman thus rushing
into the blackness of the fray. Always at her appearance they
fell back, paralyzed by the fear that they were contending
against the power of a supernatural being. The battle raged
fiercely till near noon, then the enemy fell back, their force
dwindled to but a small band.</p>

<p class='c009'>“After them!” Mahaska shrieked, springing upon her horse.
“Guards, follow your queen!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She dashed on, followed by her murderous host. The enemy
broke in wild confusion before the fierce onslaught. It
was the most complete victory which the tribe had had for a
long time. Mahaska rode back toward her village at the head
of her men, victorious and triumphant. The entire population
came out to welcome their white queen with new adoration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska told you that the prophet would fight by her
side,” she exclaimed. “Now what do the chiefs say to those
who doubted her power and would have kept her shut up in
her palace while the battle went on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The braves will follow their queen on the war-path!” was
the general cry; “now and forever.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Gi-en-gwa-tah stood silent; he was proud of the success she
had won, and it would have been impossible for him to explain
the mingled feelings which disturbed his breast. His
proud heart ached at the distance which separated him from
the woman he loved with such profound worship. He began
to comprehend that any fresh triumph, any accession of
power, forced them still wider apart, and left her more alone
in the path she had marked out to follow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X.<br> <span class='c007'>THE SIMOOM OF PASSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>For some time there had been no further communication
between Mahaska and her husband upon the disputed point
of the French alliance. Not that the woman had been idle;
she had never relaxed in her exertions among the tribes, and
she knew that not only the chiefs among the Senecas were
with her, but so many leaders among the other Nations, that
she should be able to carry the whole body at the desired
moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>She feared Gi-en-gwa-tah more than any other man; she
was confident that she had greatly undermined the influence
he had formerly possessed, but she knew that, despite her
machinations, he still was much beloved, and she dreaded the
weight his opinion and his passionate eloquence might have.</p>

<p class='c009'>But one of two things remained: either he must yield to
her will, or fall a victim to her vengeance, even if her own
hand dealt the blow. Failing that, some plot must be formed,
so thoroughly to disgrace him, that death, such as she had
dealt her old enemy, the Fox, would be a blessing in comparison.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was sitting alone in her dwelling, revolving these
thoughts in her mind, even while the child of which he was
the father lay sleeping on her knees. Her fondness for her
babe was like the love of the tigress for its young; she would
have fought for it, died for it; the idea of sharing its affection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>with any human being, would of itself have been enough to
make her hate Gi-en-gwa-tah for having a <em>right</em> to expect duty
and affection from it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The door was opened softly and her husband stood looking
in. She was so absorbed in her child, that she did not see
him. There he stood, looking at her and his sleeping son,
full of a love and tenderness which seemed almost unmanly
to his reason. He stepped softly across the floor, fearful of
disturbing the sleeping boy. She looked up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thought the warriors had gone out to hunt,” she said;
“how comes it that Gi-en-gwa-tah is here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chief wished to speak with Mahaska,” he replied,
“and so returned to the village.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She laid her child down upon a couch and turned coldly
toward him. She had grown less careful of appearances now,
and did not scruple to treat him haughtily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska holds secret councils with none of the chiefs,”
she said; “Mahaska is a queen; but what has Gi-en-gwa-tah
to say?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was deeply wounded by her tone; she had a keen satisfaction
in stabbing him with such needle-thrusts, and she
knew that he was sensitive enough to feel them keenly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There is a cloud between Mahaska and the chief,” he
said, sorrowfully; “Gi-en-gwa-tah has tried to brush it away,
but he can not; will Mahaska tell whence it comes?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She smiled scornfully as she answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah is full of fancies as a sick girl; Mahaska
can not understand them—she is a chief!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He started at the taunt; the fire flashed into his eyes; but
he did not yield to the anger which her words excited.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska keeps aloof from the chief,” he said, “and carries
her child with her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it that Gi-en-gwa-tah complains of?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The great lodge is dark to him when she and the child
are not here,” he answered, with a tenderness and simple
pathos inexpressibly touching in the hardy, stalwart man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does Gi-en-gwa-tah wish to take the place of the squaws
and tend Mahaska’s babe?” she sneered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the hot color mounted to his forehead and the flash
to his eyes, but he answered with quiet dignity:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Mahaska does ill to mock the chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He talks riddles,” she returned; “the queen does not understand.
If the chief has a message for Mahaska, let him
speak; if he has questions to demand, let him ask.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He came to tell Mahaska news which he heard only now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“News?” she repeated. “What news has Gi-en-gwa-tah
which the queen does not know? Did the birds of the air
bring it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not appear to notice the taunt; his determined composure
only served to irritate her the more.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Speak,” she cried, “and have done; Mahaska has no time
to waste in talk such as pleases old squaws.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska thought the French chief a bad man,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is,” she interrupted, “a base coward.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She wished to break off the treaty on account of it—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And it shall be done; Mahaska’s will is the prophet’s; it
shall be done. Woe to those who stand in her path!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is not needed now,” he said; “Mahaska has no more
to fear from him; the French chief has left the great city.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Left? Where is he gone—is he dead?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not dead; he has gone across the great waters—back to
his own country, and will return no more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was an unexpected and most unwelcome obstacle,
since she had fixed upon the Governor’s falsity as the principal
reason for breaking the treaty. The tidings made her more
enraged.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But another will come,” she cried, “worse than he was—baser,
more cowardly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska can not know that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned upon him with a furious gesture.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is Gi-en-gwa-tah able to tell what the queen knows;
can he read her thoughts or hear her voices?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She has not yet heard the name of the new Governor-chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tell it then!” she exclaimed; “tell it and have done.
The chief caws like a crow and utters no news at last. Who
have they sent as Governor now?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A man whom Mahaska once knew—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His name,” she interrupted, “his name!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is hard for the chief to speak; the red-men called him
Willow Bough; his nation called him—”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>He was hesitating over the word, when a sound from
Mahaska made him look up; it was like no human cry—a
strangled tiger might have uttered such a moan.</p>

<p class='c009'>He looked at her in horror. She was pale as a corpse, her
features so convulsed that they looked scarcely human—her
arms were stretched out, her fingers knotting themselves
together, as if crushing some unseen object.</p>

<p class='c009'>“De Laguy,” she cried, “Gaston De Laguy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief called her name in accents of vague terror, but
she did not appear to heed; still the long fingers writhed and
the lips muttered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gaston De Laguy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Strange thoughts flashed across the mind of the chief,
thoughts which he could not explain, but which stung like a
knife. Her terrible agitation, the tone of deadly agony and
hate in which she pronounced that name, all carried his fancy
to what he had known of her past life, and connected her
fierce hatred toward the French with that man.</p>

<p class='c009'>He had little time to indulge these painful reflections;
Mahaska tottered into a seat, her hands fell to her side, and
her strong self-control began to exert itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You bring me this news,” she exclaimed, at length, in a
voice worn and hollow from her passion; “you say there is
nothing to fear now? Blind fool, there is every thing to
fear!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is the young brave false, too?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“False!” she gasped. “A fiend from among the pale-faces
is not falser! He hates the very name of an Indian—the
Senecas worst of all! Away with all treaties—broken
from this hour! Mahaska swears it! Does the chief hear?”
she cried, turning furiously toward him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He hears,” he replied, in a tone expressive of great agitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No more talk of keeping faith,” she shrieked; “whoever
comes between Mahaska and her revenge, shall die like a
dog.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What revenge does she seek?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>In her passion she had used the word incautiously, but she
was too nearly mad to remember prudence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, revenge!” she repeated. “Mahaska hates the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>race, but that man and his pale wife worst of all! That
girl’s mother broke the heart of Mahaska’s mother; she will
have revenge! That man insulted and defied Mahaska—she
will have his heart’s blood! Let the chief beware; he is
either with or against the queen in this thing; let him think
well; so surely as he tries to thwart her, he shall meet the
doom of the Fox!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She poured out her threats fearlessly; all other arguments
had failed; fear of her anger might check him; at all events,
in her insane passion she must speak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The prophet warned Mahaska; the serpent’s nest shall
be crushed! Gaston De Laguy!” she called again, unconsciously
employing the language of her youth. “Beware!
Better have trusted to the mercy of a panther than have
crossed the sea again. Both you and Adèle, your noble wife,
shall be in my power—both—at my feet, suing for mercy
only to be trampled under foot! Revenge is now possible—give
me my revenge!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief understood enough of the rapid words to gather
their import, and his brow grew darker and sadder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly she darted toward him, and caught his arm in
her grasp.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the chief speak,” she cried, in the Indian tongue;
“does he join Mahaska or not? Must she expect aid or
enmity from him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never enmity,” he exclaimed, “Mahaska knows that.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah hesitates! This is no time for him to
choose his words! If he opposes Mahaska further, he is her
enemy; the chief knows how Mahaska can hate!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not appear to heed the menacing tone in which the
last words were spoken; she turned from him and paced up
and down the room. Once she paused and looked down
upon her sleeping child, but her face, instead of softening at
its innocent slumber, gathered new ferocity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Mahaska weigh well her actions,” said the chief, after
a pause, with a calmness which contrasted strangely with her
agitation. “This is no light matter that she contemplates;
let her not decide from her own passions—”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned upon him as if she could have smitten him to
the ground.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“Gi-en-gwa-tah speaks folly,” she cried; “is he a coward,
too? Does he fear the long rifles of the Frenchmen?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He disdained even to answer her by the braggadocio so
common among the Indians; and, though his whole frame
shook with agitation at the insulting words, his voice was
unmoved, as he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Gi-en-gwa-tah’s past speak for itself! The chief
fears to break his word; never did he do it, even when as
a boy he first began to hunt the wild deer; he could not
see his people go back from their pledges and prove themselves
false as the lying Tuscaroras, whatever their gain
might be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chief had better go among the pale-faces that he
man learn the mummeries of their faith, and turn his brethren
into black-coated owls, such as live in the stone lodges in
Quebec,” retorted Mahaska, with bitter irony.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah is content with the faith of his fathers,” he
said, still struggling to maintain his composure. “Mahaska
is not like herself to-day; her words are sharp as arrows.
Has some evil spirit taken possession of her?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A spirit that shall rend the chief in pieces if he oppose
her,” she cried, in a terrible voice; “let him beware!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah will do his duty whatever happens; he has
never yet turned aside from it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah may wrap himself in a blanket and weave
baskets in the door of his lodge; he is not fit to be a chief.
Let him prove himself a coward and the people will tear the
eagle plumes from his hair!” she exclaimed, stamping upon
the floor in her rage.</p>

<p class='c009'>He took a step forward and looked in her face with an
expression of concentrated indignation she had never seen
there before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah is the chief chosen for Mahaska,” he said.
In a deep voice; “she may be a queen, but let her not speak
base insults to her husband!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She laughed aloud, driven beyond the possibility of self-control
by the storm his words aroused, the first approaching
menace which she had ever heard from his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska chose—Mahaska can put aside; she is a queen
still! Does the chief threaten her? Let him follow her to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the village; the council shall decide between them; let him
come!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She took a step toward the door but he did not stir—not
for any price would he have had her exhibit herself to the
people while in that insane fury, which his natural dignity of
character felt was so degrading to her state.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The council can not come between the chief and the
queen,” he said; “this matter must be settled in their own
lodge, not before the eyes of all the people.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah knows well what their judgment would
be,” she answered, mistaking his hesitation for a dread of the
disapproval of the tribe; “he dare not go before the chiefs
and say that he opposes the will of Mahaska—the command
of the prophet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska speaks from her anger; Gi-en-gwa-tah does not
hear the voice of the prophet in her words.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was the first time he had ever really rebuked her—the
first time he had ever ventured to doubt her; but love gave
to the savage that intuitive knowledge of her feelings which
love alone can give; he saw she was actuated by a desire of
vengeance against the new Governor; he felt, with a horrible
pang, that in her old life that man had been every thing to
her—that it was affection turned to hate which now urged
her on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Gi-en-gwa-tah repeat those words,” she almost whispered,
in a tone that sounded like the hiss of a serpent; “let
him say again that he does not believe her visions; it shall
be the last time he ever utters such doubts.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah does not doubt her; he knows that she is
a great prophetess; but, now, she can not be speaking what
her spirits have told her, for until Gi-en-gwa-tah brought the
tidings, she thought the young French brave across the deep
waters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>That he should have in a measure penetrated her feelings
and possess acuteness to argue thus, inflamed her passion still
more; her first impulse was to kill him where he stood; only
a keen sense of the danger to herself in this act prevented
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not daring to trust herself to speak just then, she resumed
her rapid march up and down the room, while a thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>projects darted like lightning-flashes through her quick brain.
She must employ craft still, but only once more; let her keep
him from appealing to the chiefs for a few hours, and she
could render him powerless.</p>

<p class='c009'>When she had gained sufficient command over herself to
speak calmly, she paused in her walk before him—cold and
white from the effects of her fury, but forcing her voice into
a tone that sounded more natural and calm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen has reflected,” she said; “Gi-en-gwa-tah is
right; words such as have passed between them are not for
the people to hear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bowed his head to conceal the expression of anguish
which passed over it; that stormy dialogue and the revelations
it forced upon his mind, made the bitterest hour of his
whole life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska has decided well,” he answered; “but even the
lodge that holds the chief and his wife should never hear such
words.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She clenched her hands together in her loose sleeves, feeling
the necessity of some physical struggle to restrain the
insulting epithets which sprung to her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is passed is passed,” she said; “let there be no
more talk of these things; Mahaska goes to consult her
spirits.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He bowed assent to her wishes, but made no movement to
leave the room. She must have him out of the way if she
would succeed in her project.</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned toward him with a change of manner and face
so sudden and entire that it was really marvelous, and he
stood bewildered before the coming forth of her beauty from
its black cloud of anger—bewildered and fascinated, but not
with the faith and weakness of the past; through it all pierced
the fierce pain which had smitten his heart when she uttered
her vows of vengeance against the French Governor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah promised Mahaska fresh salmon from the
lake,” she said, and a sweet, girlish laugh, rung from the lips
that had before trembled with bitter denunciations; “let him
bring them to-night, that she may know her peace is made
with the chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah will go,” he replied, gravely, anxious to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>alone that he might reason away the cruel thoughts which
struggled in his heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And when will the chief return?” she demanded, carelessly
playing with the fringe of her girdle, as if she had absolutely
forgotten her passion, so changed and smiling that it
seemed hardly possible she could be the woman who had
raged there like a chained tigress only a few moments before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He must go miles up the lake,” replied Gi-en-gwa-tah; “it
will be after nightfall when he returns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska will wait for the evening meal till he returns,”
she said; “wait for the chief’s peace-offering,” and she
smiled again, with such frank sweetness that eyes more
skilled than those of the Indian would have failed to detect
the danger in its depths.</p>

<p class='c009'>She parted from him with the same pleasant manner. As
he left the room he looked back—she had taken up her sleeping
child and was pressing it to her bosom, as if all her
thoughts had centered again in that engrossing maternal love.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI.<br> <span class='c007'>A NEW LINK IN THE CHAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mahaska sat motionless until she heard her husband’s
footsteps die away from the outer room; then she laid the
child back among the cushions and hurried to the window.
She then pushed the draperies aside and looked out. From
her stand she could see far up the lake, which was lying placid
and bright in the afternoon sun. The whole scene was
one of such pleasant summer tranquillity, so out of tune with
her wild thoughts, that she gazed upon it as a lost spirit
might look into heaven. She saw Gi-en-gwa-tah come out
upon the bank accompanied by a couple of his men—stood
there and watched the canoe unmoored, and all their
preparations made complete. They were off at last, paddling
swiftly up the lake; but still she watched them until the
barque became a mere speck in the distance. Then she put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>silver whistle to her lips and blew a shrill call—her usual
summons to the squaws who attended upon her. When an
Indian woman came in she motioned her to take away the
child, resumed her eager walk for a few moments’ reflection,
but soon hurried from the house. She walked down into
into the village, pausing to speak kindly to a group of women
sunning themselves on the grass, followed, as she always
was, by looks of love and awe when she appeared among her
people, and made her way toward the lodge inhabited by the
old chief, Upepah.</p>

<p class='c009'>He was sitting there in characteristic indolence, surrounded
by several chiefs nearest his own age and dignity. When
they saw Mahaska enter so unexpectedly they arose, with the
grave courtesy she had taught them as her due, waiting in
silence for her to declare the errand which had led to that
unusual visit. Knowing that they were all in favor of her
schemes against the French, there was no need for argument
and persuasion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen has come to hold council with her father,” she said
to the old chief, “and with the wise chiefs gathered about him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is well,” Upepah answered; “let the queen speak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She motioned them to be seated, and sat down among them,
calm and deliberate in every action as was in accordance with
their habits.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen has tidings from the English chief,” she said;
“his nation are out on the war-path against the French.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They never asked how her information was acquired; in
their strong faith in her supernatural powers they believed it
easy for her to attain any knowledge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The time has come,” she continued, “to prove to the
English that the chiefs were not deceiving them in their protestations
of friendship—are they ready?”</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked at each other with a little doubt. The gifts
and promises of the British had made them eager for the new
alliance; but the burning eloquence of Gi-en-gwa-tah had
made them somewhat ashamed of the treachery they meditated,
and they hesitated to take the first decisive step which
should complete their double-dealing. Mahaska saw what
was in their minds, and hastened to remove the fear that they
were going to be called upon to commence open hostility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>against their former allies. She had planned leading them
to open war by degrees, entangling them so completely that
a positive outbreak would be unavoidable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The English chief does not ask them to make ready for
the war-path,” she said. “This is what he wishes, and the
prophet has bidden Mahaska urge its fulfillment upon the
chiefs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They listened eagerly, glad to depend upon the will of the
spirits, as pronounced by the queen’s lips, and so cast from
their minds any personal blame in the matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the chiefs send out a band of warriors to watch the
movements of the French—nothing more is desired. Mahaska
herself will go with them. If, while they are gone, the
French are guilty of any bad faith toward the Senecas, the
chiefs will not have been the first to break the treaty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked from one to another, well content to have the
matter thus arranged, and Upepah said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen speaks wisely—let it be as she wishes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No time must be lost,” she urged; “before the sun is in
the heavens to-morrow, Mahaska and her warriors must be
on their way.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the queen decide,” they answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Her own band will be enough,” she continued, certain
that not a man among them would oppose her will in any
way, but rather would second her efforts to bring on an outbreak
between the French and the tribe.</p>

<p class='c009'>She conversed with them for some time; all the plans were
completed, and her guard warned to be in readiness at the appointed
hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chiefs have acted wisely,” she said, as she arose to
go; “the prophet is pleased with them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>A satisfied murmur ran through the group. On the instant
the thought flashed through her mind to choose this moment
to plant in their minds a feeling of suspicion against
Gi-en-gwa-tah stronger than she had ever yet ventured to arouse.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen’s dreams are troubled,” she said, in a troubled
tone, turning again toward them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They looked at her in surprise, and then waited.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The time has not come for her to speak openly; but her
spirits have whispered strange words in her ear.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“Will she repeat them to the chiefs?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She can tell them, because they are old men and very wise;
but let them be silent for the present.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They will not reveal Mahaska’s words until she wills it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She went close up to the old men, and whispered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The prophet fears that the chiefs forced a choice upon
Mahaska too quickly. The chief they made for her husband
is false and ambitious, hating her for her visions and the love
the people bear her. The prophet has warned Mahaska
against his treachery; she will watch night and day; the
spirits will make it known to her; then she will bring the
matter before the whole people. Let the chiefs be silent
until she returns.”</p>

<p class='c009'>While they were still full of wonder and anger at her
words, she passed quickly from among them, and took her
way back to her palace by the lake. She had gained her
ends; from that expedition she would not return until by
some covert act she had put it out of the power of the tribe
to continue at amity with the French; but the fiercest exultation
in her breast was at the thought of the suspicion she
had aroused against Gi-en-gwa-tah—a suspicion which should
be carefully fanned until it burst into a flame that would consume
him. It was now sunset; Gi-en-gwa-tah would not return
until nightfall, and there was little fear of his even
learning any thing about the expedition until morning. Then
it would be too late for him in any way to thwart her.</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c009'>That had been a long, dreary afternoon to the unhappy chief.
When they reached their place of destination he left his companions
to their sport and wandered away into the forest,
anxious to be alone with the host of strange thoughts which
had suddenly forced his mind into such restless activity. He
could not have explained the feelings which tortured his
heart; but, even in his untutored state, his faculties were singularly
sensitive and imaginative. He was suffering the horrible
grief and jealousy a civilized man might, when the
first doubt in regard to the woman he loved arose in his
mind—a doubt that she had never returned his affection—that,
back in the life of which he knew so little, lay the only
dream of love her heart had ever known.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>There came, too, for the first time, a fear that she employed
her supernatural gifts to further her own ends, her ambition
and her hatred. He did not doubt the gifts ascribed to her,
but he began to understand how all her powers tended toward
absolute dominion, and he was stunned to see this woman,
whom he had looked upon as a creature of a higher sphere,
prove herself capable of using her prophetic wisdom as a
means of personal aggrandizement.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, even with the idea that she had loved the French Governor,
there came no thought of accepting the means of revenge
in his power against the man. By joining her plans the opportunity
would have offered itself; but a reason like that could
not tempt him to urge his people to break their pledge and
plunge into a causeless war with those he knew to be friends.</p>

<p class='c009'>So, in the midst of these torturing reflections, the long afternoon
passed away, and in the dusk of evening he returned to
his companions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Their canoe sped swiftly down the lake, and once more
Gi-en-gwa-tah entered his dwelling, but now dark shadows
walked beside him and stood between him and the woman he
had so blindly worshiped.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska received him with her brightest smiles, making
not an allusion to what had happened, but conversing only
of his day’s sport. She sat opposite him at the supper,
spread, according to her habits, after the fashion of the whites,
so gay and fascinating that he tried to think the dreadful
thoughts of the day had been roused only by his own fancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not go down into the village, so no warning of the
proposed expedition reached him, and Mahaska sat smiling at
the success of her maneuvers as she furtively watched him.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moon came up broad and full, and streamed into the
apartment where they sat. Mahaska had an appointment at
that hour, and, without deigning any explanation, she arose
to go out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska is going away?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The prophet bade her be on the lake to-night in the
moonlight; let Gi-en-gwa-tah go to his rest; perhaps Mahaska’s
spirits will set the matter which troubles him at rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He allowed her to depart in silence, no idea of opposition
entering his mind. Those midnight communings on the lake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>always had been her habit since she came among the Indians,
so that there was nothing in her going out to excite his
distrust.</p>

<p class='c009'>Left to himself, all Gi-en-gwa-tah’s painful reflections returned,
and he went out into the night to forget them in a
hurried walk. With no thought of attempting to watch
Mahaska he walked along the shore above his dwelling, lost
in the sad thoughts which crowded upon his mind. He
plunged into the depths of the forest and rushed away through
its shadows, feeling a sense of relief in rapid action. Miles
beyond the Indian village he came out upon the shore again,
and stood on a little eminence looking across the lake. The
moonlight lay soft and clear upon the waters; the shadows
of the great trees were reflected in its depths; the summer
wind sighed up softly from the wilderness and rippled the
bosom of the lake until the broad sheet of silvery water sparkled
and shone as if countless gems had been flung up from
its depths. The tranquillity of the scene must have soothed
the most agitated mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Unconsciously the chief’s mood changed, and he stood looking
across the waves with a feeling of rest that he had not
known during the whole long day. Suddenly his quick eye
caught an object far out in the lake. He gazed intently; it
drifted nearer until Gi-en-gwa-tah saw distinctly a canoe with
Mahaska seated in it, the moonlight playing about her like a
halo. He was turning away, believing that light supernatural,
and a thrill of awe ran through his frame that he should unwittingly
have been a spectator of her secret watch. Just
then his eye was attracted by an object which changed the
whole current of his thoughts. A canoe moved close by that
in which Mahaska sat, and a man was clearly visible in it.
Was it only a shadowy barque that he saw? Did her spirits
take visible shapes and thus appear to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stood spell-bound, divided between the superstition
which made a part of his religious belief, and the jealous
pang which wrung his breast. While he watched, trying to
believe that it was no human shape or earthly barque, he saw
the canoes parted company. Mahaska rowed swiftly away
down the lake while the other boat sped off in a contrary direction.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Gi-en-gwa-tah watched the strange canoe disappear, still
divided in his feelings—one moment tempted to rush up the
shore and attempt to keep the barque in sight, the next checking
the impulse as a wicked thought which, if carried out,
might bring destruction not only upon himself but his whole
people. Mahaska’s canoe had disappeared and the boat he
watched was turning a distant point. At that moment a clear
whistle sounded from it. He listened; no supernatural tones
were they. Fragments of a melody he had heard among the
pale-faces during his visits to Quebec, were given out by the
whistler with careless grace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the chief could recover from his stupefaction the
canoe had disappeared, and Gi-en-gwa-tah stood alone in the
still midnight, with his most terrible fears confirmed, his heart
wrung and tortured with pangs undreamed before, and, worse
than all, his religious faith—the faith in the spiritual powers
of the queen which had made her so holy an object in his
eyes—shaken to its very foundation.</p>

<p class='c009'>After these first moments of agony, he rushed away down
the shore, suddenly plunged anew into the forest and buried
himself in its depths, not trusting himself to return to his
dwelling until a few hours’ reflection had given him back
something of his old strength and composure.</p>

<p class='c009'>The gray dawn was breaking over the lake when Gi-en-gwa-tah
emerged from the forest and approached his own
dwelling. He saw Mahaska’s body-guard, increased till its
number consisted of at least two hundred and fifty warriors,
drawn up before the entrance to the palace. Filled with astonishment
at the sight, with his mind so racked by the suspicions
of the past that he was doubtful what their appearance
there at that hour might portend, he rushed through the
groups of savages collected about and entered the house. In
one of the inner rooms he met Mahaska, face to face. She
was attired after her usual fashion when going upon a long
journey, and every thing about her betokened the haste of
approaching departure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What are Mahaska’s warriors stationed by her palace for?”
he asked, abruptly, with a sudden conviction that some treachery
was intended by this sudden and secret move. “Whither is
Mahaska going?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>She looked at him with undisguised triumph.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chiefs have desired Mahaska to go into the forest,”
she said, “and watch the movements of the pale-faces; they
are at war.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This hides some treachery toward our friends” he exclaimed;
“Mahaska means evil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah mutters still like an old squaw,” she said,
scornfully; “but his words are weak as the wind; Mahaska
is going forth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let her wait!” he exclaimed, passionately; “Gi-en-gwa-tah
will see the chiefs; there have been false whispers in their ears.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The squaws of burthen may obey Gi-en-gwa-tah; the
warriors who serve under him may heed,” she cried, “but Mahaska
is queen of the Senecas and a prophet in the whole Six
Nations; let the young brave choose other words when he
speaks to her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Astounded at her air of defiance, and yet not to be put
aside, Gi-en-gwa-tah plead earnestly with her for a few moments,
but his words were idle. It was too late now to seek
the chiefs; there was nothing for it but submission—the wily
woman had outwitted him. She turned away without even a
show of parting, and passed out of the house where her horse
awaited. Gi-en-gwa-tah gave some order to one of the savages
and followed. Mahaska was in her saddle, exchanging
last words with a few of the elder chiefs who had come up to
witness her departure, when Gi-en-gwa-tah rode up to her side
mounted on his war-horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>She stared at him in haughty anger and surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whither goes Gi-en-gwa-tah?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“With Mahaska and her warriors,” he replied, with quiet
firmness which she well understood.</p>

<p class='c009'>For an instant it seemed as if she would give way to the
storm of passion which this determination aroused; but it was
checked by a sudden thought of the danger of such a course
to her schemes at that moment of their initiation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let him go—she would not oppose it. During this journey
the long-sought opportunity to ruin him should be found; in
his blind obstinacy he had rushed toward the fate she held in
store for him. Her brow cleared; she gathered up her reins
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“Mahaska is glad that the chief accompanies her; he shall
be one of her warriors now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He did not return the smile, for he understood perfectly the
meaning she intended to convey—that the expedition was entirely
under her control, and that, in accompanying it, he went
without any authority. Still, he did not falter in his resolve;
he <em>must</em> learn the truth of his doubts concerning her. Besides
that, his presence might be the means of preventing any trouble
between her party and the French; but, in that, he counted
upon an influence which he no longer possessed. Mahaska’s
guard were bound to her by blind devotion, and her slightest
wish would be their law. With them the chief was powerless.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='c007'>THE SECRET JOURNEY AND THE HIDDEN TREASURE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The long-threatened war between the French and English
betokened its nearer approach by numerous aggressions upon
both sides, and skirmishes became frequent.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this time Gaston de Laguy had been appointed Governor
of Canada. He was a young man to hold an office of such
importance, but there had been a variety of peculiar circumstances
which led to his appointment, and among those which
most induced him to accept the position had been the health
of his wife, Adèle. She had been the adopted daughter of
Count de Frontenac, the former Governor, and was the playmate
of Mahaska in her childhood, as well as the hated rival
of her girlish years, for she had won the love of de Laguy
whom Mahaska had worshiped with a passion bordering on
frenzy in its intensity and reckless disregard of conventional
proprieties.</p>

<p class='c009'>Madame de Laguy’s health had declined after the birth of
her first-born, and the physicians decided that a return to
Canada and the enjoyment of the free air of the wilderness, in
which so much of her early life had been spent, would conduce
more than all their skill to restore her to health. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>they had returned to Canada, and, though Adèle retained few
pleasant memories of the country, she was content to remain
there for a time, since she could have the enjoyment of her
husband’s society and that of her child, with the prospect of
recovering her wasted strength.</p>

<p class='c009'>The love between de Laguy and his beautiful wife was
something truly impressive to witness. They seemed to have
grown so closely into each other’s souls that not even death
could disturb the ties which bound them.</p>

<p class='c009'>The birth of their boy drew them still more closely together,
and, content with the world of happiness which they could
center in their home, they came unrepiningly out to the New
World. During the summer, business of importance took the
Governor to Montreal, whither his wife and child accompanied
him. While there, they received intelligence of the arrival
of an old friend and relative of de Laguy at Quebec, and, as
the Governor could not leave for some time, Adèle determined
to return at once in order to welcome him at the gubernatorial
castle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The parting between the young husband and his wife was
very painful, but it would be only of brief duration, and the
Governor saw his treasures depart under the charge of a numerous
escort without fear for her safety or anxiety beyond
the pain of separation. The Governor’s wife made the journey
in boats, and, as the weather was delightful, the trip was exceedingly
pleasant.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle did her best to shake off the oppression which parting
from her husband had caused, with the unselfishness
which made one of the most beautiful traits of her character,
and endeavored to make every return for the efforts which the
officers, who commanded her escort, employed to render her
journey pleasant. So she drifted on toward her own sumptuous
home, counting the days in her loving heart as blanks in
her life till they brought back her husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>While this journey was taking place, Mahaska and her
band of warriors were threading the forest till they reached
the vicinity of the St. Lawrence. It had been a dreary journey
to Gi-en-gwa-tah; Mahaska had paid very little attention to
his presence, but she never missed an opportunity to make his
slight impatience apparent to the band, and to irritate, him by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>a thousand feminine efforts of malice. Still, he would not
speak harshly to her; in spite of all, he loved her with the
fervor of a noble heart that has set all its hopes on one object.
He suffered cruelly and he changed greatly during those long
days, but he bore up bravely under the heart-martyrdom which
she inflicted on him. But he watched her; doubt and
jealousy grew every day stronger in his mind. If once fully
convinced that she was deceiving his people, all his love would
not prevent his exposing her plots; his keen sense of honor
and right would not have allowed him to remain silent.</p>

<p class='c009'>So they journeyed on, but nothing arose to throw light upon
the trouble in his mind or to make the reason of this hasty
journey more apparent. He could neither eat nor sleep; all
his faculties seemed absorbed in that eager suspense as if some
great crisis were at hand and he was waiting for its approach.</p>

<p class='c009'>Besides her other reasons for this expedition, Mahaska had
one which was unknown to any human being—a project
which she might not be able to carry out at that time, but
which was swayed by the passion in her nature next in magnitude
to her thirst for powder and revenge—her love of
wealth.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a plan which would be very difficult to carry out,
and in which she could not trust even the most faithful of her
band, resulting from a secret confided to her by her grandmother,
Ahmo, just before her death, a few months previously.
It was Ahmo to whose baleful influence the child of Count
Frontenac owed much of the unnatural ferocity of her nature.
It was Ahmo who had instilled into Mahaska’s mind the idea
that Frontenac had poisoned her mother—she it was who had
inspired the girl with the idea of a queenly supremacy over
the tribes of the Six Nations, by whom her mother’s father,
the great chief and prophet Nemono, had been held in the
greatest reverence. After Mahaska’s rejection by the gay
young cavalier—de Laguy—to whom she made a remarkable
proposition of marriage, but who rejected her strange suit and
soon wed Adèle, Mahaska’s foster-sister and companion—the
half-breed’s passions were in a fit mood to bend to the will of
Ahmo’s cunning and treacherous nature, and the girl passed
off among the Indians to become their queen and prophet.
Old Ahmo’s implacable soul only stayed long enough in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>worn out body to see her grandchild the wife of one of the
Seneca braves and the acknowledged princess of the tribe.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was just after Mahaska’s arrival among the Senecas, that
she was one day sitting in her lodge, reflecting upon the savage
life which now she had chosen, when the draperies were
flung back and Ahmo entered the apartment. Her form was
bent; her steps tottering and feeble, and it was evident that
she was rapidly passing away beyond the restlessness of this
life.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had been for several days confined to her bed; Mahaska,
hence, looked in astonishment at her entrance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo could not rest; she longed to see her grandchild
once again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska would have come to you,” she said, kindly;
“Ahmo is feeble; she should not be out in the chill air.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old woman sunk down on a pile of furs near Mahaska
and began muttering to herself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo is tired, very tired,” said Mahaska, compassionately.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo is dying,” replied the old woman, calmly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska started; the idea of death was terrible to her
then; she could have met it once with fortitude, but now
blankness and desolation were abhorrent to her proud nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>“All night she heard the voices of Nemono and her daughter
Chileli,” continued the old woman; “they are waiting for
Ahmo; they have made ready her lodge in the happy hunting-grounds.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo will stay yet with Mahaska, and watch her greatness
increase till it is beyond that of all the chiefs,” said the
white girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old woman shook her head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Three generations have blossomed before Ahmo’s eyes;
she is very old and wants rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can she not rest in Mahaska’s lodge?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But she wants the rest without dreams that they sleep
down yonder by the water; Ahmo is old, and Chileli calls.
She must go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She was silent again for some moments, then added:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo has a secret for her grandchild.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has Ahmo kept secrets from Mahaska?” she asked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>reproachfully, her heart softening strangely at the woman’s
changed face and feeble manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo will tell it now,” she returned. “There was no
need till she was ready to go forth in search of Nemono.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo could have trusted her child.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She knows it. But Ahmo was old; she loved power;
she had grown miserly—Mahaska will not be angry.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska is never angry with Ahmo; let her hear this
secret.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska remembers the island lodge where she used to
come and stay when a child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl’s features contracted as they always did at the mention
of any thing connected with that portion of her life;
but she bowed her head in token of assent and motioned the
old woman to proceed, not trusting her voice lest it should
startle the sick woman by the passion it betrayed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Below the lodge,” pursued Ahmo, “there stand two willow
trees. Mahaska has not forgotten them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not likely; as a child she had played under their
shadow; as a girl she had sat there weaving her wild visions;
often in her sleep had she heard the rustle of the long branches
as they swayed to and fro, to awaken, suddenly, almost believing
for an instant that the events of the past had been a
dream, and that she was still a girl in the old lodge on Orleans
Island.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska will find a little knot at the foot of the lower
tree; let her dig it away and push back the bark—she will
see a box that was Chileli’s, Mahaska’s mother—it is full of
gold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska was not greatly surprised; she knew that in her
mother’s lifetime Frontenac had paid a large sum to old Ahmo,
but she always averred that it had been squandered among the
tribe.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How much gold has Ahmo there?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman named the sum—it was much larger than Mahaska
expected, and the avaricious greed in her soul woke at
once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why did Ahmo leave it there?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman returned some vague answer.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska can get it,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“But how? It will not be easy for Mahaska now to go
so near Quebec. It would have been better to have brought
the money when Ahmo came on to join the tribe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old woman shook her head. The possession of that
secret hoard had been one of the chief delights of her old
age; nothing but the approach of death could have induced
her to reveal her mystery even to her grandchild. She had
bitterly lamented leaving it behind when she was forced to
leave her home on the island, but she feared that it might be
discovered by some watchful eye, and so concluded to leave
it in its hiding-place.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It may have been stolen,” Mahaska said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no,” returned Ahmo, with more energy than she had
before betrayed; “Ahmo did her work well—even with the
knowledge she has given her, Mahaska will find it hard to discover
her gold.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska was reflecting upon some means of placing the
gold in her own possession. She had no one whom she
chose to trust on an errand like that, while to go herself was
an undertaking not at all agreeable to contemplate. The
thought of increasing her wealth was delightful enough in itself,
though there was a much broader passion than mere
avarice reigning in her mind—the greater her wealth the
more extended her influence. Gold and power—her soul centered
its hopes on the two.</p>

<p class='c009'>She looked at Ahmo and her heart softened again—she
could not conceal from herself that the old woman was dying—a
little time and she would be alone of all her race.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska is not angry with Ahmo?” the woman demanded,
rousing herself quickly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Angry? no! Mahaska loves Ahmo; her heart is knit fast
to that of her grandmother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old squaw’s face lighted up with a gleam of pleasure.
She crept nearer to her grandchild and sheltered her head in
the folds of her dress.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo only kept her treasure secret to please her old age;
it will be all Mahaska’s now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo did well; Mahaska cares nothing for the gold,
she would rather see her grandmother strong and vigorous
than to possess all the gold the world could offer.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>The old woman smiled; she was touched and gratified by
these words of affection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska shall be happy,” she said, “because she is kind
to the aged woman; she loves her grandame.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When the spring comes, Ahmo will grow strong again,”
urged the granddaughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman lifted her head warningly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo will never see the snow fall again; let not Mahaska
deceive herself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She supported herself against the furs and motioned Mahaska
to sit by her side. She sat for a long time silently regarding
her, then she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska will be a great queen; Ahmo only wishes to
live long enough to witness her marriage with the chosen brave
of her tribe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ahmo will surely live,” Mahaska replied, more touched
than she had thought to be by the scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She believes so,” said the woman; “Ahmo will watch
over her from the spirit-land; let Mahaska be content.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At last she rose as well as her feeble strength would permit
and tottered away—she pressed a last kiss upon her
grandchild’s forehead and made a sign of farewell as she
turned to move away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska will go with you,” she said</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no; Ahmo can still walk; she <em>must</em> keep her
strength; she must live to see her grandchild go home to Gi-en-gwa-tah’s
lodge.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There never had been any further conversation between
them on the subject, for the old woman died suddenly during
the midst of the festivities which had followed the wedding
of Mahaska. For a long time after that event Mahaska had
been too much occupied with her own fortunes to devise any
means for obtaining the coveted gold; but she had by no
means forgotten the affair, and, during this expedition, she
trusted to find an opportunity of approaching sufficiently near
Quebec to go to the island of which her grandmother had
spoken, in the hope of obtaining possession of the gold she
had buried there, although she knew well that such an expedition
would be very perilous and it might be impossible at
the time.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII.<br> <span class='c007'>THE CAPTIVE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Many a wild thought raged in Mahaska’s mind, too wild
for reason or control, but all bearing to one end. She rode
on day after day, haunted by the idea that some unlooked-for
event would place it in her power to wreak the vengeance
she yearned for against the Governor of Quebec, and so bring
at once her wishes to a fulfillment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska had her scouts out in every direction. They had
received strict orders to report to her without informing Gi-en-gwa-tah
of any discoveries they might make. Gi-en-gwa-tah
had gone one day with several companions on a hunting
excursion. Mahaska wishing to rid herself of his presence,
had expressed a desire for him to bring her venison and
game of his own shooting, and her slightest request was still
his law.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska was sitting in her tent, several miles back from
the river. She had determined that if no opportunity to
annoy the French offered, she would at least visit the island
in person before the neighborhood of the Indians should
become known, and then return to Seneca lake, having possession
of the buried treasures which Ahmo’s ingenuity and
avarice had secured to her grandchild.</p>

<p class='c009'>One morning a scout approached her tent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What news?” she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Many boats on the river,” he answered, “going up to the
great settlement.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who are they? Did Omene hear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is reported that the Governor-chief is sending his squaw
back to the great settlement,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska sprung to her feet with the bound of a lioness.
She had learned the fact of De Laguy having become Governor
of Quebec: the thought that Adèle might again be
thrown in her power fairly dizzied her with its promise of
torture to her hated foe and his despised wife. Having questioned
the man minutely, she dismissed him and sat down to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>arrange in her mind the project which had so suddenly been
called into life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Toward sunset she selected a number of her body-guard
and set out in the direction of the river. One of the savages
was sent in advance, to await the coming of the boats and
learn the exact order in which they were journeying. It so
chanced that the boat which carried the Governor’s wife had
fallen behind. Adèle, having placed the nurse and child in
another canoe, sat conversing with a female acquaintance who
was accompanying her on her return to Quebec. It was
growing almost twilight; they had reached a point where the
river took a variety of short curves, and the bank was so
thickly wooded that the boats often lost sight of each other.
Still, the officer who had command of the expedition had
given no orders for the canoes to be kept more closely together,
as there was scarcely a supposition of danger in the whole
journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two ladies were conversing so eagerly that they did
not observe that the other boats had passed out of sight.
But the rower seeing this, was bending forward to make new
exertions, and they were just passing a dark point of the
forest, when he was struck violently upon the head, lost his
balance, and fell backward into the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>The two women sprung up with a cry of dismay; at the
same instant, several Indians burst out of the thicket and
plunged into the water. The boat was seized and dragged to
the shore, and Madame De Lenneville, as she fell insensible
in the canoe, heard one last shriek from the hapless Adèle,
and saw her borne off in the arms of savages.</p>

<p class='c009'>That appalling cry brought back the other boats; they saw
the canoe drifting down the current with the lady’s companion
lying senseless, but neither the oarsman nor the Governor’s
wife were to be seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a long time before Madame De Lenneville could be
restored to consciousness, and even then, her senses were so
confused by the shock, that she could give no clear account
of the occurrence.</p>

<p class='c009'>Further down the river they found the body of the oarsman,
who had been so stunned by the blow that he could
make no effort, and was swept passively down the stream.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>To Madame De Lenneville’s excited imagination, the number
of the savages appeared immense, and the officers decided
that nothing could be done but to push on to Quebec for
assistance, as any attempt to follow the Indians with their
little party would only result in a general massacre.</p>

<p class='c009'>They hurried on through the gathering twilight, every
breast tortured with anxiety. The child awoke and moaned
piteously for his mother. The sound was a new agony to
her friends, for but few of that little party ever expected to
see the Governor’s wife alive.</p>

<p class='c009'>The queen’s body-guard bore the hapless lady swiftly along
through the forest, answering neither her cries or supplications.
After the first moments of agonizing fear, her thoughts
were of her child. Anxiety kept her senses all acute; she
had not even the blessing of insensibility. Once or twice she
caught glimpses of men on horseback galloping before them
through the windings of the forest; but she could distinguish
nothing more. No one spoke to her. She was a prisoner.
Mahaska was one of the riders—she urged her horse forward
into the camp. Gi-en-gwa-tah met her, but before he could
speak, she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prepare every thing for our departure; we must be miles
away before the dawn breaks.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our queen rides fast,” he returned, with a feeling that she
had been upon some lawless errand. “Whence comes she
in such haste.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Gi-en-gwa-tah keep silent,” she exclaimed; “it is not
for him to question the descendant of the prophet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned to the Indians, and issued her commands for
an instant departure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where are the rest who went out with the queen?” demanded
the chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are coming through the forest,” cried Mahaska.</p>

<p class='c009'>She pointed down the path. As the chief looked, the party
carrying Adèle appeared in sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A prisoner!” he exclaimed. “What has the queen done?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wife of the French Governor is Mahaska’s prisoner,”
returned she, with a fearful laugh. “This time, these hands
shall strangle the viper; there is no escape now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief uttered an exclamation of horror.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“The Nations have not declared war,” he said, hurriedly;
“Mahaska will ruin herself by this act.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fool!” she exclaimed. “Will you try to teach Mahaska?
Out of my path, or I will trample you under my horse’s feet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But he stood his ground firmly, and after one prolonged
glance of fiendish hate, Mahaska turned toward her prisoner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle caught sight of her old friend and arch-enemy, as
she was seated upon the powerful black horse. A light from
the fires fell full upon Mahaska’s face, and in spite of the
changes evil passions and her wild life had made, Adèle recognized
her foster-sister at once. From that instant she
resigned all hope; she uttered no cry, but remained gazing
at the face turned upon her as if fascinated by the glare of
those basilisk eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The savages placed her upon the ground. She leaned
against a tree for support, but did not turn her eyes from the
face of her captor.</p>

<p class='c009'>A cold, deadly smile wreathed the white queen’s lip. She
bowed low, with an affectation of extreme courtesy, and said
in her blandest voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Queen Mahaska bows herself before the guest who honors
her camp; the wife of the French Governor is welcome.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle shuddered at that voice, for she knew well the hatred
and danger expressed in its accents.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Katharine!” she exclaimed, involuntarily, calling her by
the familiar name which she had borne when a child in her
father’s castle. “Oh, Katharine, what harm have I done
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska started; wrath surged into her face, but she controlled
the rising tempest, looked carelessly about, as if to see
whom the lady had thus addressed, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The pale-face wanders in her mind; there is no one here
but Mahaska and her braves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why have you brought me here?” cried Adèle. “What
have I done to you, that you should pursue me with such remorseless
hatred? Only set me free, and my husband will
pay you any ransom. Name your price—but let me go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The smile died from Mahaska’s lips. She leaned forward
in her saddle, and hissed from between her clenched teeth:</p>

<p class='c009'>“He must offer it for your dead body then, for he will have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>no time to make other terms. All the wealth of France would
not purchase your life. Mahaska does not sell her hate.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle’s overwrought faculties gave way at those fearful
words, and, with one low moan, she fell senseless almost under
the horse’s feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska motioned the Indians to raise her and turned
coldly away. The preparations for departure were going
hurriedly on. Gi-en-gwa-tah had been standing near, and
being sufficiently familiar with French to understand, had
comprehended the conversation that had passed between the
two women. He looked pityingly at the white face, so pure
and girlish still; then he turned toward the pitiless woman,
sitting there so unconcerned, to make one last effort.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the queen reflect,” he said; “she is doing a dangerous
thing—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Queen Mahaska loves danger,” she interrupted, without
even glancing toward him. “Let the fire be put out; let the
guard make ready!” she called, in a loud voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Mahaska at least wait here till the day breaks,” urged
the chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>She turned upon him with a look of contempt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait here that the dogs of pale-faces may come up and
rescue her?” she exclaimed. “Is the queen a mad woman
to heed such advice? If Gi-en-gwa-tah had no other counsel
to offer, he had better leave off his eagle plumes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief was stung beyond endurance by the insult.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah is indeed a chief,” he answered, “and Mahaska
is only his wife, only a squaw, in spite of the favor his
people have shown her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The woman turned upon him in speechless rage; her right
hand moved slowly, as if clutching for her tomahawk, but he
paid no attention to the menace.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wife of the Governor-chief shall be returned to him,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who will give her back?” she almost whispered, in the
hoarseness of her rage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah,” he replied. “The chief will not permit
his people to be false and treacherous, to gratify the anger
a woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah will give her back?” she repeated, slowly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“He will do it. The French are our allies; we will keep
faith with them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She bent her head with mocking reverence.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah is a great chief,” she said; “he wills a
thing only to be obeyed. Let him command the queen’s
guards to give up her prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah does command,” he replied; “here he will
be obeyed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The principal warriors had pressed nearer, and listened in
silence to the altercation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The braves hear,” said Mahaska, turning toward them;
“let them tremble before the frown of Gi-en-gwa-tah; they
are his slaves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>An angry murmur went through the throng. Mahaska saw
her advantage and went on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does it please Gi-en-gwa-tah that the pale-face should be
sent back to-night?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>He understood the mockery in her voice. Worse still, he
perceived that he was quite powerless. The chiefs drew
around Mahaska, avoiding him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Once more, Gi-en-gwa-tah asks the queen to reflect,” he
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The great prophet teaches the queen,” she returned. “The
Six Nations wish to break their treaty with the French. When
they dance about the death-fire of the Governor’s wife, they
will feel that they are repaid for many wrongs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It shall not be!” cried the chief. “The pale-face shall
be given to her husband.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let Gi-en-gwa-tah save her then!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He started forward, ready in his single bravery to attempt
the fulfillment of her mocking words, but at a signal from
Mahaska, he was surrounded by her guard. He dropped his
bands and stood gazing upon his captors with a look of angry
sorrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah sees that Mahaska commands here,” she
said, slowly. “Let him go back to his place among the
chiefs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah leaped upon his horse and rode close to
Adèle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every thing was by this time prepared for the departure;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the insensible Adèle was placed upon a horse behind one of
the guards, and the whole band started rapidly off through
the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah rode in silence close by the white captive;
his face was stern but sorrowful; the mortification he felt at
the insult which he had received was light compared with
the pain he endured at feeling the power of Mahaska’s hate.</p>

<p class='c009'>They rode on through the darkness of the night, Mahaska
giving way in her thoughts to the fierce joy which the capture
of her innocent enemy had cast upon her soul. So great was
her exultation, that she made her horse leap and prance
through the darkness in the exuberance of her glee. This
time there should be no escape; her own hands should deal
the blow that terminated that guileless life, and she would
send the scalp fringed with those golden tresses back to the
agonized husband, with only these words: “Katharine is
avenged!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle came to her senses, only to find herself borne swiftly
away further and further from all hope of rescue. She looked
back; the starlight showed the pallid, terrible face of the
woman who had brought this misery upon her. She closed
her eyes to shut out the awful vision of fiendish beauty, and
allowed them to bear her on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Husband! child!” was the agonized moan that broke
from her lips; their sufferings made her forget her own.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska caught the convulsed cry.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the pale-face shriek,” she said; “the flames of her
death-fire will soon scatter the darkness she dreads so much.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So they rode on. The cold stars looked pitilessly down;
the wind shivered by, seeming to bear her the moans of her
loved onces, and at intervals the voice of that dreaded woman
struck her ear like a warning of the terrible doom of the
stake and the death-fire.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV.<br> <span class='c007'>IN BONDS AND OUT OF THEM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>All that night and the next day, the savage troop sped on
through the forest. When twilight came, Mahaska issued
orders for a halt. She had paid no attention to Gi-en-gwa-tah
after their conversation the night before, and he had ridden
on almost unnoticed, keeping close to the white captive. The
mingled wrath, indignation and sorrow which filled his mind
it were not in the power of words to describe. But all the
while his pity for the unfortunate captive rose more strongly
than those harsher feelings. He was horrified by Mahaska’s
base treachery; every instinct of his honorable nature rose
up against it. He knew that his expostulations would only
increase the dangers that menaced the captive, and might,
indeed, lead to her instant death. He foresaw that when they
reached the tribe, Mahaska’s will might not be disputed, and
that any arguments he could employ would be treated with
disdain by the chiefs, so completely were they under the control
of the imperious woman. For the first time he fully
realized the extent of Mahaska’s power. He now only became
fully conscious of the terrible uses she would make of it.
Warfare and strife were the rightful inheritance of his savage
nature, but uprightness and truth were equally well rooted
there, and he shrunk in abhorrence from the unscrupulous
path along which she intended to lead his people. There
was but one way open to him—he might be able to effect
Adèle’s escape. He would bend all his energies to accomplish
that, and thus save any further open conflict with his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the second evening came, the Indians proposed to
encamp for the night. Adèle became so exhausted by the
hard journey, that her guard was obliged to support her on
her horse. She had sunk into a state of passive misery, from
which, at intervals, a keen pang would rouse her as some
recollection of her husband or child intruded like the sudden
thrust of a dagger. Mahaska rode all day a little in advance
of her prisoner. She was in one of her most agreeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>humors, conversing gayly with those about her, and ever and
anon her clear laugh would ring on the air, mocking Adèle
with recollections of the time when that sound had been full
of pleasure to her ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah had on the previous evening effected a reconciliation
with Mahaska. Not that she forgave him for
venturing to oppose her, or had, in the least, resigned her
revengeful determination; but, like Catharine De Medicis, she
loved to bestow her softest smiles and blandest words upon
those whose destruction she was plotting.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once or twice during the journey, the chief had found an
opportunity to make a slight sign to Adèle which filled her
heart with a hope, only to die out in new agony as the hours
wore on and the distance lengthened between her and all
prospect of deliverance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will rest here to-night,” Mahaska said, as she dismounted
from her horse. “Let the tent be spread, but,
before the dawn, all must be ready for departure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska’s prudence would not allow a fire to be kindled,
although there was no probability that their pursuers could
be anywhere within the neighborhood, but she was determined
to run no risks where her hapless captive was concerned.
Adèle was taken off her horse and seated upon a
pile of blankets near Mahaska’s tent. The moonlight was
sufficient to make every object distinctly visible, and, as she
sat there in the vacancy of her despair, she could see the
woman moving briskly about, superintending every arrangement,
doubling the usual number of sentinels, appointing a
portion of her guard to watch near her place of repose, and
employing every means of security that vigilance, sharpened
by revenge, could devise.</p>

<p class='c009'>They placed food before the captive; but at first she turned
from it with sickly loathing, and again Gi-en-gwa-tah passed
her, and she heard him whisper rapidly in broken French:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the pale-face eat—she will need much strength before
the dawn comes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She could not repress one start; he moved on with a warning
gesture, and seated himself with his back toward her at a
considerable distance. She took up the piece of bark upon
which the food had been spread, and ate eagerly of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>corn-bread and dried venison; she had been so many hours
without food, that the supper brought back an increase of
strength, and the new hope which stirred her heart added
sudden vitality to her frame.</p>

<p class='c009'>While she was sitting there, Mahaska approached and stood
looking down upon her with an icy smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This is not like the castle to which the Governor’s wife
is accustomed, and in which my mother pined herself to
death,” she said, with cruel sarcasm; “Mahaska hopes to
receive the lady in her own palace before many days.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle made no answer; she was looking in the woman’s
face, wondering if it could indeed be real—if she saw before
her the girl in whose arms she had so often slept in peace
and affection, with whom she had shared every hope and
joy, and whose happiness had been the chief study of her
young life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can you, indeed, be Katharine!” she exclaimed, involuntarily,
giving expression to her thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The pale-face mistakes,” returned Mahaska, with a warning
quiver in her voice; “I am Mahaska, queen of the
Senecas, a prophetess among the Six Nations. If the whites
gave her another name, she flung it in the dirt with every
thing else that was theirs.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you were once my friend,” cried Adèle, nerved by
desperation to make one last effort to touch her heart. “I
loved you as a sister—I shared every hope, every enjoyment
with you; surely, all recollection of the old time can not have
died out of your soul, Katharine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has not!” she exclaimed, with sudden passion; “Mahaska
never forgets! You came between me and all that
makes life endurable—you trailed the venom of your smile
over every hope of my heart—you usurped my place in the
house of my father—you made me an outcast, an alien, and
then dared to insult me by offering your pity to her you
called the ‘poor half-breed!’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Had you been my own sister, I could not have loved you
more fondly,” returned Adèle. “Oh, Katharine, give up those
cruel thoughts—even now, I will forget the past and be your
friend—”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska interrupted her with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“Queen Mahaska can not express her gratitude for the
honor Madame De Laguy offers her,” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Katharine, do not mock me with such cruel words
There <em>must</em> be some tenderness left in your heart! I implore
you, by the pious teaching we learned together in the convent
for the love of the Virgin, whom they taught us to venerate,
to show mercy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The superstitions of the pale-face found no resting-place
in Mahaska’s mind,” she replied. “I am an Indian, the faith
of the red-men is mine. I once was Katharine the half-breed
but now am Mahaska, queen of the Senecas!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By your father’s memory—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He broke my mother’s heart that yours might fill her
home; forced me out of his heart to give you a place there;
do not rouse <em>that</em> recollection.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle wrung her hands in anguish.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have a husband,” she cried, “perhaps a child; oh
by the love you bear that little one, have mercy on my poor
babe!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska clenched her hands in the loose sleeves of her
robe and cried in a terrible voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I have a son, and thanks to you and yours, his father
is an <em>Indian</em>! Your cowardly prayers can not touch my
heart! I tell you, before three days are gone, the winds shall
bear the smoke of your funeral-pile toward the husband and
child of whom you boast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle sunk back in her seat and covered her face with the
folds of her mantle. Mahaska stood for an instant, regarding
her with fierce joy. Then she turned to move away. When
Adèle heard the rustle of her robes and comprehended that
she was leaving her without a word, she flung out her hands
and cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stay, stay—hear me yet!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska paused and looked down upon her with the same
scornful smile wreathing her lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the pale-face speak quickly, Mahaska has no time to
waste in hearing complaints.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your nation is at peace with the French,” said Adèle,
eagerly; “this act will break off all friendship between
you—”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“Does the pale-face threaten?” demanded Mahaska, with
a calmness more appalling than her rage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, no! But you would not be guilty of an art of treachery—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Enough!” interrupted she. “The Six Nations are no
longer at peace with the cowardly Frenchmen; they are weary
of being cajoled and treated like slaves; the hate that fills
their queen’s heart now inspires the tribes. We are your enemies
and fear not!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle let her hands drop in her lap. She had exhausted
every appeal, every argument, but the woman only remained
the more merciless and immovable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can say no more,” she sobbed, brokenly; “kill me
then. But at least show me one mercy—end my sufferings
at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska caught her wrist, fairly hissing in her face:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall die by inches! Would that you had a hundred
lives! I have the heart to crush each with unheard of torture!
There is no hope—no release! You shall be my slave.
There is no degradation I will not heap upon you—no outrage
you shall not endure! Death shall be long in coming;
every torture, every groan shall be reported to your false husband,
and crush him with its agony.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She thrust the wretched creature wildly from her and went
away without another word, leaving Adèle crouched upon the
ground, so overcome by horror that she could not even comfort
her misery by a prayer. She sat upon the earth motionless,
until one of the savages approached and made signs that
she was to enter the tent. She comprehended that Mahaska
did not intend to lose sight of her even for an instant; there
was no possibility of release from the panther’s lair.</p>

<p class='c009'>She crept into the tent and lay down upon the greensward
that covered the earth which it shadowed like a carpet, but
sleep, worn out as she was, would not come to her relief.</p>

<p class='c009'>There she lay, listening to every sound, while the moments
appeared like hours, and it seemed to the hapless creature that
death in its most terrible form would not be so hard to bear
as the agony of that suspense. She could only lie there in
passive immobility, trying to murmur broken prayers, at times
roused into keener torture by the thought of her husband and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>child, seeming to hear their voices call her, springing up on
the furs with a wild belief that it was real, then sinking back
overwhelmed with fresh agony by the consciousness of her
own delirious fancies.</p>

<p class='c009'>So the night dragged on, but what time passed, whether
moments or hours, the girl could not tell.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the camp grew quiet, Gi-en-gwa-tah saw Mahaska
start softly away toward the forest. Once he might have
thought that she had gone to consult her spirits, but the events
of the past few days had blotted out his superstitious belief;
he determined to follow her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska walked on under the forest-boughs until she
reached a little natural clearing, and paused. The moonlight
made the place clear as day. He saw her glance narrowly
about, as if she were not certain of its being the place which
she sought. Suddenly her eye caught some white fragment
fluttering on a blasted oak, and the chief saw by her face that
it was a signal which she had expected. She took her whistle
from her bosom and sounded a low call. This was answered
from a neighboring thicket, and soon Gi-en-gwa-tah saw a
man, gliding from the underbrush, approach her. The watchful
and now excited chief crept slowly toward the log where
Mahaska had seated herself. He paused within sound of
their voices, concealed perfectly by a clump of bushes. He
could see the man’s face now, and recognized the half-breed,
Rene, whom he had seen in Quebec.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have had no opportunity of speaking with you until
to-night,” Mahaska was saying in French.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You have ridden fast, day and night,” he returned; “I
had difficulty in keeping in advance of you, but this was our
last meeting-place, so I thought I should meet you here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know who is with me?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A prisoner I could see, but nothing more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She laughed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A prisoner, indeed! Go back to the English General and
tell him queen Mahaska has indeed shaken off all faith with
the French: she carries with her the wife of the Governor of
Canada!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The spy gave a start of mingled fear and astonishment
her reckless daring.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“The French will be mad!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ay, ay!” she said. “But let them come! I am ready
to meet them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean to demand a heavy ransom?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A ransom!” she repeated; “for <em>her</em>! Man, there isn’t
gold enough in all France, to buy <em>her</em> ransom!”</p>

<p class='c009'>She checked herself suddenly and added in a calmer tone:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind what I mean, Rene, but listen to what I bid
you do. Go back to the English General and tell him what
has happened; tell him that my prisoners are my own and
he can not interfere; but my people will now be with him to
a man. The next battle he fights, tell him to call for as
many warriors from the Six Nations as he may wish.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The spy bowed respectfully. One could see in his wicked,
crafty face, how his petty soul was overawed by the woman’s
boldness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rene will do his errand well,” he said; “the queen has
always been content with him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, yes! You will tell the General that before long the
queen hopes to see him; she has many things to tell, many
plans to reveal which are for his ear alone. Tell him this,
that soon she will reign alone among the Indians, and then—but
no matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah was listening breathlessly to her words; the
spy looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the queen has a husband, a great chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Bah! the power that made can unmake; Mahaska will
soon sweep the traitor from her path—his days are on the
wane.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Even in that terrible moment, bitter sorrow was the prominent
feeling in the chief’s mind as he heard those words.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Has the queen any other message for the General?
Would she like more presents for her palace?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, the house is well supplied, Rene. My people believe
those gifts came from the Great Spirit. What would they
think if they knew you were one of his messengers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She laughed as she spoke. How the last spark of faith
had gone out in Gi-en-gwa-tah’s mind; he comprehended all
her falsity.</p>

<p class='c009'>For some time longer she conversed with the spy, but as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>they rose to go, Gi-en-gwa-tah crept away through the bushes,
anxious to reach the camp before Mahaska.</p>

<p class='c009'>His course was clear. Her treachery and deception must
be exposed to the tribes at the first opportunity, but he could
not think of that now; he had another work to perform. He
must save the wife of his ally; that very night she must be
removed beyond the reach of Mahaska’s vengeance. Silently
as he glided away, some sound reached Mahaska’s ear. She
touched the spy’s arm warningly, and both bent their keen
eyes in the direction to which she pointed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska caught sight of the retreating form and recognized
the chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is Gi-en-gwa-tah!” exclaimed the spy; “he has overheard
us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It matters not,” she replied; “this only seals his fate; an
hour after our arrival at the lake village, you should hear his
death-song if you could be near.”</p>

<p class='c009'>She waved a careless adieu to the spy and walked rapidly
away toward the camp. She soon entered the tent—threw
off the fur cloak she had worn during the evening, flung her
coronet of feathers upon it and lay down on the bed. Once
she drew near Adèle, but the sleepless captive closed her eyes
to avoid the sight; and, apparently satisfied that her victim
was sleeping, Mahaska turned away for repose. A drinking
cup had been set near her bed, for she never slept without
a cooling draught within reach of her hand. Before lying
down, she quaffed a deep draught and covered herself up
with furs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle heard the sound of her breathing, and ere long she
was sleeping heavily. Then, there was a grating upon the
side of the tent—a warning whisper reached her ear; a face
appeared at an aperture close by the ground, and in the
moonlight she recognized the features of the chief, Mahaska’s
husband.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the pale-face rise,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>He caught her hand when she moved, suddenly, and drew
her toward him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen will not wake,” he said; “her cup was drugged
from the medicine-flask. The pale-face must put on the
queen’s own fur mantle and coronet, and walk out of the tent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>and go slowly down the hill. She will find Gi-en-gwa-tah
there.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief disappeared and Adèle rose to perform his bidding.
It seemed to her that she did not move; she was unconscious
of feeling any great eagerness; her limbs felt half-paralyzed;
the shock of a new hope had fairly benumbed her
faculties.</p>

<p class='c009'>She saw that Mahaska had not stirred. Then she put the
coronet on her head, threw the mantle over her shoulder, and
gathering the folds about her face passed out of the tent. At
the entrance a sudden thought occurred to her; she crept
back to her bed, heaped some loose furs together on the spot
she had occupied, so that if Mahaska awoke, it would appear
as if some one were lying among them; this done, she passed
out into the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The guards were dozing near the tent, but as it was almost
a nightly occurrence, when in camp, for Mahaska to walk
abroad, sometimes for hours, when the tall form passed them,
wrapped in the rich mantle and crowned with the familiar
diadem, they did not move, and the fugitive walked on. At
length she reached the trysting-place at the foot of the hill.
She then beheld the chief waiting under the trees, mounted
upon his horse. Without a word, he raised her in front of
his saddle and dashed off through the wilderness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The pale-face must have courage,” he said, after a time;
“before many hours she shall be with her friends. Gi-en-gwa-tah
left signs along the path which will guide them.
When the day breaks, let the lady watch; she will see her
companions coming.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was long before Adèle could feel that she had escaped—that
she was on the path to freedom and safety. She could
not weep; a low prayer went up from her inmost soul—that
was all. She tried to speak a few broken words of thankfulness,
but the chief checked her with grave kindness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah understands the pale-face; let her be silent—he
has sad thoughts in his heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On, on, they sped through the great forest. The morn
waned, the dawn broke, the sun rose and lighted the wilderness
with its golden gleams.</p>

<p class='c009'>Adèle recognized many a vine-wreathed rock and picturesque
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>nook which, during the previous day, she had seen vanish
into distance with a feeling of despair; now she watched
them fade with hope growing stronger in her soul, for they
put space between her and the danger which had menaced
her life.</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c009'>The officer who commanded Adèle’s escort had sent intelligence
with all speed back to the Governor, and on the next
day the frenzied husband had reached the scene of his wife’s
capture. Without an hour’s delay, he was rushing through
the wilderness in pursuit of her, but he dared not even hope;
he felt instinctively in whose hands she had fallen, and almost
sunk under the horror of the thought.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was after midday, but the horse of the chief still kept
gallantly on his way, as if he understood the danger from
which he was bearing his charge.</p>

<p class='c009'>They reached a sudden rise in the path, when the forest
gave place for a little distance to a natural opening. Looking
down the slope, Adèle saw a band of horsemen approaching.
Even at that distance, she recognized her husband, and
stretched out her hands with a cry of such exquisite happiness,
that the chief looked down upon her with sad envy.
The horseman rushed up; in another moment Adèle was
clasped in Gaston’s arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the first burst of thankfulness was over, Adèle’s
broken words made him understand all the chief had done.
The Governor turned toward Gi-en-gwa-tah, who sat on his
horse gravely watching them, and tried to express his gratitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief checked him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah has acted aright,” he said; “the French
were the friends of the Six Nations; bad counsels have led
them astray, but Gi-en-gwa-tah can not endure treachery. He
has brought back the Governor’s wife; let him take good
care of her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He turned his horse to go; Adèle cried out with eager
words of thankfulness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the Governor make his way on with all speed,” said
the chief; “long before this the queen is on his track.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He urged his horse on, and the Governor’s band turned
back upon their homeward route in all haste.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>It was sunset, and the chief paused a few moments to rest
his weary horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>He foresaw clearly the peril in which he had placed himself
by the act he had committed, but it did not shake his
firmness—he had acted as his conscience urged—he hoped,
too, that the chiefs would yield to the justice of his report,
and the queen would submit herself to their decision; for he
now saw clearly that he must dispossess her from power to
save the ruin of his tribe.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was not till morning that Mahaska learned what had
happened. The potion had worked well, and all through the
night she had remained in deep, dreamless slumber. Her fury
burst forth like a torrent, and when told that the chief was
gone, she understood every thing. After the first spasm of
passion she calmed herself, and, followed by her retinue, started
off in pursuit; but they rode all day without discovering any
trace of the fugitives, beyond the occasional footprints of their
horse.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the glory of the sunset the band galloped toward the
spot where Gi-en-gwa-tah had paused. When Mahaska saw
him she grasped her tomahawk as if to hurl it at his head;
but, his calm courage checked her presumption, and she
dashed toward him, crying out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What has Gi-en-gwa-tah done with the pale-face?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He evinced no emotion at her sudden approach, and answered,
quietly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“She is safe with the Governor-chief. Gi-en-gwa-tah has
kept the queen from doing a great wrong and bringing much
harm upon her people!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Coward!” shrieked Mahaska. “Dog! you shall die
with all the tortures reserved for her! Secure him—bind
him, hand and foot, and drag the traitor before his chiefs.”
Her guard sprung forward to obey her order, but the chief
lifted his musket and called out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah is your chief. The first brave who
touches him, dies. He will go before his people—they shall
judge him—not you, who are slaves of this woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They shall, indeed!” cried Mahaska; “he is a dog, and
shall die a dog’s death.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief turned upon her like a lion at bay.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Let the woman beware; Gi-en-gwa-tah has borne in silence
long enough; for her own sake, for her child’s sake, let
her pause and think, before her craft is exposed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let him speak—who will heed his lies? What he means
to say has been already revealed to Mahaska; he will dispute
her power—he will say that the prophet does not direct her—that
the Great Spirit did not fill her dwelling with gifts—let
him speak—the queen laughs!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He stood confounded by her words; he was at a loss to
understand how she could have penetrated the secret he had
discovered, and stunned by the matchless audacity with which
she avowed it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah may well look troubled,” she said; “he
can not doubt the queen’s power, in spite of his lies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He does doubt it!” he cried. “He knows that she is
false—that the gifts which fill her home came from the English—he
will tell all at the council—”</p>

<p class='c009'>She interrupted him with a fearful denunciation, and again
cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Secure him! Obey, or every guard shall hang before to-morrow’s
sunset.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The guards rushed forward again—the chief leveled the
foremost with a blow of his musket, but he was speedily overpowered
by numbers and soon bound hand and foot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Guard his horse,” cried Mahaska; “death to him who
allows the traitor to escape! Now, on toward the lake!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They paused neither for rest nor food till they came in
sight of Senaca lake—Mahaska was so eager for revenge that
she could hardly breathe till the moment arrived. Once only
did the chief condescend to address argument or rebuke for
the baseness and enormity of her conduct. She was riding
near him for the moment, urging on the band to renewed exertions,
when he turned toward her, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska has done a wicked thing; she is not worthy to
be a queen among a brave people—Gi-en-gwa-tah can die—but
his memory will be a curse that shall drag her down.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The dog snarls no longer!” she exclaimed, with a bitter
laugh; “he begins to beg now; let him show his teeth to the last.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah has no fear,” he answered; “Mahaska has
not made the people wholly blind.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“Gi-en-gwa-tah shall teach them to see,” she retorted;
“they will listen to his voice—they will drive Mahaska into
the forest at his bidding.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the queen wait,” he replied, with a calmness which
galled her beyond endurance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The queen will bandy no words with a traitor,” she cried;
“let the dog without a name be silent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His savage nature was on fire at the indignity with which
he had been treated; he shook his pinioned hands, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska is mad, and she will drive her people to destruction.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She will not betray them, as Gi-en-gwa-tah has done!”
replied the woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah did that which was right; he does not
need to be taught by a woman.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he shall die by a woman’s hand!” she cried. “His
death-shrieks will be sweet in his son’s ears!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He can die with a war-cry on his lips that his son shall
remember,” he answered, proudly; “but his time is not yet;
his people now, more than ever, need his counsel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah’s power is like a broken reed,” she said;
“Mahaska rules the Senecas and soon shall rule the Six Nations,
for it is the prophet’s will. She tells him that he <em>shall</em>
die and he shall!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would the queen murder the father of her child?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska’s child is the gift of the Great Spirit!” she exclaimed;
“he has no other father.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska speaks lies! She is false as an adder!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And her bite is more deadly. The chief shall feel it
soon!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He does not fear! Let the band hasten on; Mahaska shall
see how her people will receive her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Gi-en-gwa-tah shall hear their cries of hate,” she
answered; “they will tear him limb from limb when Mahaska
tells them all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah will speak for himself; he does not need
a squaw to be his mouthpiece.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He smiled scornfully at her passion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“On!” she shrieked to her guards. “The queen can not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>breathe the same air with that dog—on with him to judgment!”</p>

<p class='c009'>They answered with a fierce shout, in which the chief
seemed to hear his death-warrant, but he did not quail.</p>

<p class='c009'>“These dogs are not chiefs,” he said; “they are only slaves
that the squaw has bought with the gifts the English gave
her. The chiefs will allow them no voice; they will be
driven out of the tribe for their insults to its chief.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They answered with menacing murmurs. Mahaska’s first
impulse was to put him to death on the spot, but she waited;
it was better to taste her revenge to the full. He should be
punished in the presence of the whole tribe, as a warning to
all who might ever after dare her displeasure. Thus she
would confirm her power, and in his death, by decree of the
council, would she make the chiefs confess her supremacy.
After that, her word would be law, and even the council would
be harmless.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XII.<br> <span class='c007'>THE SPELL BROKEN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mahaska and her band of warriors rode into the Indian
village with their chief a captive in their midst.</p>

<p class='c009'>The people came out to meet them, and when the shouts
of joy that greeted the queen’s return had died away, Gi-en-gwa-tah
lifted his pinioned hands, and cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Behold the way in which your chief is treated! He
comes among you, bound like a dog!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He suffers the disgrace of a traitor!” exclaimed Mahaska,
“and the lips of the tribe shall pronounce upon him a traitor’s
doom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The savages pressed about him in great confusion at the
strange sight, and the words which the two had spoken.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah demands instant judgment!” cried the
chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The chiefs gave Mahaska command of the expedition,”
said the woman, turning to the old men. “She has fulfilled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>their wishes. She is weary and will commune with her
spirits; she asks that they may not meet in council till nightfall.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The wily creature, it was apparent to her husband, desired
to employ the interval in winning the principal warriors entirely
to her cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let the council sit now!” exclaimed Gi-en-gwa-tah; “the
chief is not to be kept bound at the bidding of a squaw.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His violent words excited the interest and astonishment of
the greater portion of those present. Their favorite chief and
husband of their queen a prisoner and a traitor!</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Upepah advanced, after a moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I demand the council shall convene at once, for by delay
to consult her dreams, this bad woman means to pour poison
into your ears. I demand the council-fire to be lit <em>now</em>.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It shall be as the chief demands,” Upepah added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It shall not be!” shouted Mahaska, fairly beside herself,
and fearful of the power which her husband’s eloquence would
bring to bear against her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mahaska is queen, not chief,” said Upepah. “She will
not command now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She <em>will</em> command. She <em>will</em> consult the prophet before she
goes to the council. It shall be as she says; nor will she release
this dog until he goes to the council.” She spoke with frenzied
energy, and looked like a Nemesis of fury.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She dares not go where Gi-en-gwa-tah will expose her
wicked craft and tell the story of her past crimes. Let
my people only hear me and her power is gone forever.
She then becomes my squaw, and the Senecas shall be
saved from the destruction which she is plotting. To the
council-chamber!” The chief rose upon his horse, extending
his pinioned hands to the sight of his braves and the chiefs.
Upepah stepped forward, and, with his knife, severed the
thongs which bound his wrists.</p>

<p class='c009'>Unable longer to control herself, the infuriated woman
hurled her tomahawk full at Gi-en-gwa-tah’s head, but it
passed harmlessly by him and buried itself in the brain of old
Upepah, who sunk to the earth a corpse!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Seize her—seize her!” cried a dozen voices at once,
maddened as they were at the atrocious deed. But she drew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>herself up proudly on the horse, her eyes flashing and scintillating
like a serpent’s.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let him who wants to die,” she hissed, “but touch a hair
of my horse’s mane. Guards!” she added, in a tone of
imperious command, “see to it that that dog does not
escape. I will be at the council-chamber at nightfall.” With
that, she turned to ride away for the castle. It was the mistake
of her life, to leave her husband there with the people
whom he might harangue, and, over the dead body of the
aged chief, might recall the Senecas to a sense of their
baseness and humiliation in submitting to the tyranny of a
woman. But, she could not do otherwise; for the dead
Upepah was a power she dare not face, and she resolved to rely
upon her own resources for any emergency that might arise.</p>

<p class='c009'>Gi-en-gwa-tah, at the fall of the old man, had leaped from
his horse, and was leaning over him when the queen rode
away. The bloody tomahawk he placed in his own girdle.
Then he gave orders for the removal of the body to the council-house.
The guards still hovered around as if to execute
the queen’s orders for his secure keeping, but he did not notice
them, and no attempt was made for his seizure. Arrived at
the council-lodge, the crowd paused while the body was borne
within. None but chiefs entered, at first, but Gi-en-gwa-tah
ordered the old warriors to enter and the young braves to surround
the building, that they might hear all that was said—a
very unusual proceeding, for the young men had never been
permitted even to hear the discussions in the lodge.</p>

<p class='c009'>All was still and solemn as the death-scene within demanded.
Soon, however, the voice of Gi-en-gwa-tah broke the stillness.
At first it was low and monotonous, as if but the expression
of commonplace phrases; but soon it grew in volume, and
the attentive crowd without caught his words. They were
the words of one who spoke with great pain, of one whose
own wrongs were past expression. The speaker suddenly
paused, and all outside thought his speech ended. It was but
a moment’s lull, for, like a thunder-burst, his cry of mingled
scorn, anguish, and offended honor rose wild and high, penetrating
even to the forest beyond the lodges. The savages
were riveted to the soil by the tremendous fury of the speaker’s
eloquence—were silent and motionless as the great oaks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>around. Higher and fuller rolled forth the volume of words.
In the strong imagery of the Senecas’ figurative tongue, he
painted not his own but his people’s abasement in permitting
the will of a woman, proven to be artful as a serpent and as
cruel as a wolf, to rule them. His language was, at times,
that of resolution and defiance; then he uttered a reproof
calculated to sting the Indians’ sense of honor; all at once, the
picture of a nation humiliated by English insolence, bleeding
from its feuds, sorrowing for its braves lost in an unholy contest
against their old friends the French, sprung to vivid reality before
their startled gaze, and the dread silence without was broken.
A long, low howl, resembling a wail, broke over the masses;
it was the wail of men roused to their danger and eager to
retrieve it. Ere it had died away, the chief bent over, raised
the body of the dead Upepah in his arms, held it aloft, crying
in his loudest tones:</p>

<p class='c009'>“As this body of our wise chief is a mark of the queen’s
regard for our old men, it is but a type of the fate in store
for the Seneca nation if she is permitted to exercise dominion
over it. If it is your will to retain her as your ruler, then
Gi-en-gwa-tah is a dog—a woman’s whelp—made to die by
her hand as Upepah has died, and as others who oppose her
will shall die. <em>Let</em> him die rather than live and see his people
a lost, ruined, and disgraced race.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He ceased, and stepping forth from the council-lodge, placed
his hands together and shouted:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Guards! do the duty of your queen, and make your
chief a dog!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Not one of the hundred chosen braves stirred; they stood
abashed and awed before the noble man. Soon a murmur
ran through the crowd of young men surrounding the lodge;
some clutched their tomahawks and looked fiercely at the
silent guards; others talked excitedly together; a powerful
body gathered around Gi-en-gwa-tah, until he was encompassed
by a human wall which it were dangerous for any person to
attempt to penetrate. Within the council-chamber now arose
the sound of voices engaged in dispute. Gi-en-gwa-tah listened.
The chiefs were disagreed as to the course to be pursued.
Some were for banishing the woman from their midst;
some would have her slain; others would retain her, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>deprive her of power. It was a moment of extreme pain to
the chief; for soon surged up in his bosom his old love of
the dazzling woman; she was the mother of his child, too;
could he see his wife disgraced, driven away, or consent to
her death? The struggle for a minute was fearful, for the
cup was indeed bitter; but, there came back to him the last
few days’ experiences—the remembrance of her scorn and
galling insults—the knowledge of her duplicity and craft; and
he was decided. She was no longer his wife—she was not
the mother of his child, for she was a beautiful monster, as
loathsome as a serpent and as treacherous.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Guards!” he shouted, “bring hither Mahaska, the squaw
of Gi-en-gwa-tah!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The hundred men did not, for a moment, seem to comprehend
the nature of the order.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dogs! I say, bring hither your woman master!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The men moved slowly away to their task, for the fire in
Gi-en-gwa-tah’s eyes, and the fierce temper sitting like a thunder-cloud
on the features of the young braves surrounding
him, proved to the guards that to disobey would be their own
death-warrant.</p>

<p class='c009'>They had not to proceed far, for Mahaska appeared on her
way to the council. She was pale, and evidently intensely
excited, though outwardly composed. Her dress was elaborate
and gorgeous in the extreme, all the resources of her
magnificent wardrobe having been taxed to add to her display.
Evidently she knew what had transpired—some one
of her body-guard probably having informed her of the proceedings—and
she came forth realizing that the great and
final crisis in her fortunes was to be faced. She was not unprepared;
but, little did she know of the terrible strength of
the elements against her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Walking with a step of haughty independence, she passed
on, the crowd giving way before her, and approached the
lodge through an avenue of men. As she neared the entrance
she confronted her husband, who stood with folded aims in
her path.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Away with you, dog—traitor—coward!” was her greeting.</p>

<p class='c009'>She had determined, it was apparent, to carry her point by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>force—too proud, too defiant to yield, at that crisis evoked
by her own fury.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chief stepped not out of her way, but more completely
before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gi-en-gwa-tah will no longer permit a squaw decked in
gewgaws presented by the English hogs as the price of her
baseness, to address him. Thus he disposes of these emblems
of disgrace and treachery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He deliberately seized her coronet of feathers and dashed
it to the earth; then her splendid cloak and trail of crimson
velvet he stripped from her shoulders. She was speechless
and powerless before this unexpected display of audacious
assumption, but, recovering in a moment, she caught the jeweled
dagger from her belt, and, quick as thought, aimed a
blow full at his breast. His hand was too rapid in its movement,
for he caught her wrist in his vice-like clutch, drew the
poniard from her grasp, and threw it away. He unclasped
from her arm its serpent wristlet of gold and blood-stone,
wrenched from her neck the splendid necklace of pearls and
crown diamond. This done, he led her unresistingly into
the lodge. Proceeding to its center, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here is the murderer of Upepah—the attempted betrayer
of my tribe—the deceiver and impostor. Do with her as you
will. Gi-en-gwa-tah repudiates her as his wife; she is no longer
the mother of his child, and he casts her forth as the enemy of
his race—the destroyer of his peace. Henceforth she is not
even to him a slave. Gi-en-gwa-tah bids her away—away forever,
for the door of his lodge is closed against her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With that he left her, disrobed and disowned, standing
alone in the center of the circle, while he took his seat on
the ground in the first rank allotted to the leading chiefs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is well!” said the eldest of the chiefs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is well!” was slowly and solemnly repeated in turn by
every one of the circle save Gi-en-gwa-tah, who sat as one
conscious of his triumph, but too dignified, too much afflicted
by the events of the hour to betray his feelings further. He
was as impassive in his grief and pain as a statue of bronze—as
insensible as a rock.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska stood as one in a dream. So sudden, so unexpected,
had been the act of Gi-en-gwa-tah, as to confound her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>while the conscious justice of his act seemed to strike her
nerves powerless. Then that line of faces, as hard and as dark
as flint, all acting with one common impulse of sympathy and
duty, convinced the queen that she had, indeed, passed from
power and was a queen no longer. This consciousness was
overwhelming; the long pent-up, warped and perverted woman’s
nature asserted itself; tears, so strange, so almost unknown
to her wild, fierce breast, welled up in her eyes and
dropped upon her bosom; a low moan, something like a wail
and a sigh, broke from her white lips; and, clasping her hands
over her heart, she turned and walked slowly out of the lodge
toward the castle. All eyes followed her, but not a soul approached,
for all respect for and fear of her had not passed
away in that act of dethronement and widowhood. She was
alone in her sorrow, and was so absorbed by it as to be unconscious
of all things else. Once or twice she paused, and,
for a second, the old baleful light of uncontrolled passion
would gleam in her eyes and redden her cheeks; but only for
a second, for the deadly whiteness would quickly return, and,
with a gasp, a smothered sob, a suppressed cry of anguish
painful even to the dullest sense, she would hurry on, evidently
eager to reach the shelter of her lake retreat. How hateful,
how reproachful all looked to her now! Everywhere were
tokens of her deception and treachery; every article of English
gift was a silent witness of her duplicity; but amid them
were the gifts of costly furs from her noble husband’s hands,
and oh, how they rebuked her! Strange that never before
this woman, so shrewd, so sagacious, so intellectual, had
looked upon herself in her true light!</p>

<p class='c009'>But, she saw it all now; and not more desolate was the
lonely pine on the mountain, with the wind sobbing and shrieking
through its branches, than the soul of that proud, crushed
woman at that moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Proceeding at once to her chamber, where she had left her
boy asleep, she found his little couch of furs vacant—he was
gone—was not there to receive her parting kiss! Thus was
the cup of her agony made full, but, in her self-abasement, she
felt that it was just the outraged father should have removed
him. Mahaska sunk upon a seat and gave way to her great
grief. Ah, it was terrible to witness. Such grief could only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>come from the conscience-stricken, from the wretch conscious
of his own debasement past all redemption. For an hour she
remained in her fearful agony—not over her wrecked fortunes,
over her lost empire, over the detection of her true character
and her humiliating exposure, for all these things her fierce
nature could bear; but that she was an outcast, scorned by the
savage who had loved her like a Spartan, despised by the race
among whom she had come as prophet and queen, and, more
than all, that she, a mother, was childless as well as a banished,
disgraced wife—all these made her hour of agony one
passing all words to depict. That hour had one redeeming
virtue—it proved that she was a woman, and taught us to
know that beneath the fury of the most violent natures is a
deep of humanity and purity which will assert itself at the propitious
moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>At length Mahaska arose, gathered up some of the child’s
little garments and some of her own clothing, which she made
up into a light bundle. Then she took from the drawer of
her dressing-case a purse of gold, and her jewels, which she
placed in her bosom. A tomahawk and jeweled dagger she
cast upon the floor, but, thinking a moment, she picked up
the dagger and placed it in her belt. This completed her
preparations for the exile; like Hagar, she was banished, but,
unlike the Jewess, she had no child to comfort her and to suffer
with her. Bestowing one long, agonizing look upon the
child’s bed, murmuring his name in tones of endearment, she
passed out of the castle, by the door looking out upon the
lake. Her canoe she pushed off the sands, and, entering it,
swept off over the waters just as darkness began to make
somber shadows in the forests. Away she sped—out into the
gloom until suddenly she vanished from sight, whether swallowed
up in the deep waters or caught up into the clouds the
Senecas could not divine. They had watched her departure
in awe and in fear, for their superstitious souls still were filled
with images of her divinity; and when the canoe suddenly
vanished it was only to confirm their impression of her league
with spirits—whether with the good or the bad spirits, they did
not care to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next morning Mahaska’s canoe was seen floating on
the bosom of the water in the center of the lake, but she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>gone. It was brought to the shore and given to Gi-en-gwa-tah.
The chief received it as a token of her final departure and
placed it in the castle. Then he closed the building and it
was left in all its loneliness, sitting upon the shore of the lake
like a watcher daily and nightly awaiting for its mistress to
come again, but she came not.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mahaska, the Indian Queen, was no more.</p>
